<i>AUTHOR'S NOTE</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The incident, in essentials true, of the soldiers in
the railway carriage, overheard by "Cyprian," is
the seed from which this book grew.  To explain his
attitude, it is, therefore, included with acknowledgments
to that Editor of the</i> "PIONEER" <i>who first
recorded it for me.  "Shoan and the Mermaid" is
also true, as an example of a tale told to the Nicobarese
by a traveller, and retold by them, and may be found
in Sir Richard Temple's Census Report, preserved
to the best of my belief in the Offices of the Chief
Commissioner in the Andamans.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>I make no apologies to my old friends, Scarecrow,
Friend-of-England and others for describing them
under their own names, feeling sure that they would
expect no evil magic to come of it.  To the workers
of the Mission at Car Nicobar, one of whom it is
well-known spent twelve years in the islands
translating the Prayer Book into Nicobarese, I would say
that little Jellybrand is only the portrait of a type I
have met&mdash;of which is the Kingdom of Heaven, and
which neither looks for nor will find recognition on
earth for much simple heroism.</i>

YOU THREE,
</p>

<p>
This fulfilled promise, possibly, by now, nearly
forgotten by you, will find the four of us in different
countries, or even different continents; but find you
it will, to recall to your minds a memory of five long
weeks, during which we formed a perfect square;
when, alike under the Colombo palms or the hot
rocks of Aden, among the lights of Port Said or in
the shadow of Gibraltar, the discussion, ever and
again, would veer round to that which the fool hath
said in his heart.
</p>

<p>
People on this earth evolve and alter; it is to
you, as I knew you then, that this is addressed.  Try
to put back the clock and think as you thought then.
</p>

<p>
I have still in your neat hand-writing, "C"&mdash;I
wonder whether your prescriptions are as clear
to read?&mdash;the account of your conversion to that
Spiritualistic Theosophy which used to make
"L.B." impatient.  I inserted the page in the first
book I wrote for you all, but which, to the agent's
surprise, I suddenly withdrew, doubting lest I was
still too near the Three of you and those endless
conversations to have made my characters impersonal
enough and, also, doubting the fairness of putting
into cold print anything which had been given me
in the special circumstances of our friendship.
</p>

<p>
So Cyprian and Ferlie come late on the scene to
show you by their problem much that I have left
unsaid (even to you, "L.B.") during the star-spangled
nights in tropical waters and, afterwards, in the
grey streets of Westminster and those greyer and
darker streets elsewhere, down which the Other Half
live and the Men in Black go to and fro.
</p>

<p>
Let me say now, since it was hardly permitted
for me to tell you then, that what you did was one
of the bravest things I have ever known a man do.
This, in case you have, in retrospection, doubted
and regretted the impulse as abnormal or unbalanced.
</p>

<p>
Some travellers across my horizon last winter
recognized your photograph, and I gathered from
them that you are now on the way to be reckoned
among the Senior and the Great.
</p>

<p>
To you, "C," I have always wished to confess,
in acknowledgment of your wisdom as physician
and psychologist, that your warning nearly came
true and, two years ago, I thought a great deal
about it, and you, in hospital.
</p>

<p>
And of you, "L.L.": I have often wondered
whether you found your Golden Girl according to
Le Gallienne?  Well, I owe much to the passing
of our ships: hence this dedication.
</p>

<p>
I have only the one wish for you all Three, but
particularly will "L.B." understand it: it is, that
to the end of the voyage you may be able to trust
the Pilot you have chosen.

THE FRANTIC MASTER
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p>
When a man has been turned down by the Only
Girl (although she isn't, and never was) and,
subsequently, finds her present in the same batch of
dinner-guests as himself, it is hardly to be expected
that he will prove the life and soul of the party.
</p>

<p>
But, thought Mrs. Carmichael, vexed with herself
for a blundering hostess who ought to have known,
and still more vexed with Cyprian Sterne for not
having waited until after the 17th to try his luck with
Muriel, there was no need for him to gloom at his
soup as if he were gauging its depths for a suicidal
dive and there was no need for him to have waved
aside the champagne.  Champagne was clearly
indicated on the occasion, medicinally, if not (as she
felt inclined to insist, herself, despite appearances)
in felicitation.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian always showed himself so ridiculously
sensitive.  And Muriel looked so ... adamant.
Yes, that was the word; hard and bright like a
crystal prism you could not see through clearly,
however often the attractive suggestion of buried
rainbows within might tempt you to hold it close
to your eyes.  With the closeness even the rainbows
became blurred.
</p>

<p>
"An incarnation of the three B's which constitute
the Perfect Woman," said her men-admirers.
</p>

<p>
Brain, Beauty and Breeding.  All by heredity.
No wonder she behaved as if she had the right to
wealth also, of a standard not to be extracted from
the scholarly pockets of Cyprian and his like.
</p>

<p>
Had he a like?  Mrs. Carmichael doubted.  She
wondered what mislaid edition of Persian verse or
Grecian ethics was, even now, spoiling the symmetry
of his evening coat.  A little bowed, the shoulders,
even when he stood upright.  The scrutiny of the
very blue eyes a little fixed when he addressed you
with that air of seeing behind things which betrays
the short-sighted.  Interesting, the long dreamy face,
but hardly handsome.  And his acknowledged cleverness
did not flash in your face like Muriel's, so that,
waiving her awareness of his Double Firsts at
Oxford and all that, she had been heard to tick him
off as "a dry old stick."  Encouraging his transparent
admiration the while.  Minx!
</p>

<p>
One had wished he would hurry up and propose
and get the inevitable yearnings for a premature
grave over and then forget.  And now he had
completed the first item on that programme&mdash;most
inconsiderately before the 17th&mdash;and the yearnings
were upon him and he was ruining his end of the
dinner-party.
</p>

<p>
Muriel sat opposite him and it was comprehensible
that he should not want to look at her and,
therefore, incomprehensible why he insisted on
trying to.
</p>

<p>
As usual, she was worth looking at.  Those very
fair women, particularly when dressed in soft watery
greens, recalled old legends of sirens who floated
gold hair about their insinuating bodies, luring
mankind by music and provocative laughter to its
destruction despite the warning, eternally present,
of white bones on the sand.
</p>

<p>
A pity that Cyprian's mental vision was as myopic
as his physical when it came to those bones.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carmichael could see them quite clearly
herself: here, the skull of Major Ames (a nice little
man, and of course, that hunting tragedy <i>had</i>
proved an accident, although at the time They
said...) there, the femur, rather nobbly, of Maurice
Waring who had parted, not exactly with his life,
to be sure, but certainly with his wife since sighting
the siren's shining head.  But those two had never
got on anyhow, and if, eventually, he managed the
divorce ... how much more nearly would he and
Muriel prove birds of a feather than she and poor
Cyprian with his good old-fashioned conviction
that this modern laxity in matrimonial matters was
a national menace.  Refreshing, to find a man like
Cyprian, even though as he was not safely religious
one was inclined to wonder, when it came to personal
influence, would Muriel...?  Mrs. Carmichael's
subconscious musings (for consciously she was
smiling eager attention to ex-Colonel Maddock's&mdash;he
was now, by virtue of a dead American wife,
by way of being a millionaire, which is far
better&mdash;account of his last yachting cruise, and praying
Providence for the strength and the strategy to
resist suggestions that she and Robin should join
him next time) were shattered by the despairing
howl of what sounded like a soul in torment.  Only,
it emanated from regions too nearly at the top of
the house to be described as "nether."
</p>

<p>
"It's that child again," remarked Robin accusingly
down the long table, interrupted in an intense
discussion with Miss Mabel Clement, the
playwright: "I have always said we would suffer for it
if you were so weak with her in the beginning."
</p>

<p>
"To any child born in the East, English nursery-life
is impossibly terrifying," and Mrs. Carmichael
apologetically sought the support of her guests.
"Since Peter went to school she has had to sleep
alone.  It's all very well for Robin to call me weak
but I can't believe it is good for a child's nerves
to..."
</p>

<p>
Another wail crescendoed to the uttermost heights
of horror and died away.
</p>

<p>
"That noise does not improve mine," Robin
Carmichael answered dryly: "What is the nurse
thinking of?"
</p>

<p>
"It's her evening out."
</p>

<p>
And, inwardly, his wife sighed for their return
to Burma where servants did not have evenings out,
and ... and people were too enslaved to official
etiquette to show their feelings at dinner-parties.
</p>

<p>
A chair grated harshly back, rumpling the rug
on the polished parquet floor.
</p>

<p>
"Let me go up to her for a moment," said
Cyprian, "I undertook to visit the nursery when
I arrived but was told she had gone to sleep."
</p>

<p>
Well, if it would take his mind off himself and his
stricken face from the vicinity of the Hon. Mrs. Porter,
who was beginning to wear a worried look.
Mrs. Carmichael knew that Robin would say that
it was all wrong, of course, in the morning, but she
could hardly let Ferlie howl throughout dinner and,
if the parlour-maid went up, Rose would have to
hand round the fish single-handed and she was
under notice to go, and therefore, under no obligation
to behave.  In Burma there had always been someone
to sit with Ferlie if she woke.
</p>

<p>
"Tell her to go to sleep at once then," and Ferlie's
mother favoured Cyprian with an indulgent smile.
His fondness for the child was really too quaint.
In the circumstances, pathetic.
</p>

<p>
The incident might well arouse Muriel's better
nature ... but no, not quite.
</p>

<p>
It would, in all likelihood, encourage her worse
one, since she was no character in a book written
with a mission behind it.  Already her clear eyes
were glinting humorously and something she remarked
to Captain Wright, in an undertone, had just made
that young gentleman, who never at any time
required much encouragement to giggle, choke
violently into his napkin.  Why couldn't Cyprian
realize that he didn't in the least want Muriel, but
a Womanly Woman of Yesterday?
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Cyprian, incapable of perceiving his
desire for any woman, save one who was the figment
of his own imagination, clothed in a blurred
semblance to Muriel Vane, mounted the stairs to an
airy room with a sloping roof which lent queer
profundities to the dancing shadows born of Ferlie's
night-light.  Found Ferlie sitting up among the
pillows with the sheet over her head and the fear of
the devil in her soul.  Ferlie, at seven, was afraid of
darkness, being accidentally buried alive, and wolves.
Not lions and tigers: only wolves.  This, since she
had never seen a wolf; though tigers, looking loose
and heavy, had been marched across her horizon
more than once by excitedly shouting coolies, when
everyone was in holiday camp and Mr. Carmichael
had been out shooting.  They inspired sympathy
rather than respect in that condition, and lions,
naturally, slipped into the same category of beasts
one's father could, if he so desired, bring home on
poles and transform into carpets for the bungalow.
Wolves were different.  She had a book concerning
their activities in a land called Siberia.  They chased
people there for miles and miles over stuff like
ground-rice pudding, commonly known as "snow,"
and even ate the sleigh.  England, in which she now
found herself, might very easily resemble Siberia in
this particular: it was cold also, and snow came
with cold.  The birth of the being-buried-alive fear
dated from a conversation overheard between her
parents anent the accuracy of the Bible with regard
to the reappearance from the grave of one, Lazarus.
</p>

<p>
Her father was a thoughtful sceptic, but Ferlie
did not find him out for many years.  Her mother's
views were founded on the Book of Common Prayer
and the story, "There, but for the Grace of God
..." though she was divided in her mind whether
Bunyan had invented the one and Gladstone said
the other, or vice versa.  Her own father, a bishop,
and a busy one, had rather taken her catechism for
granted when he confirmed her, on the assumption
that a daughter educated in a godly ecclesiastical
household and never exposed to the youthful heresies
of a boarding-school must necessarily be in a perpetual
state of knowledgeable grace.  And he had passed
on his gaiters as a matter of course before retiring
to her elder brother.
</p>

<p>
Her husband explained away miracles by Euclidean
methods which struck terror to her orthodox heart.
</p>

<p>
"A possible and recorded case of suspended
animation," had been his verdict on Lazarus.
"Occurs every day.  Read <i>Hudson's Psychic
Phenomena</i>."  Mrs. Carmichael had no intention of
doing any such thing.
</p>

<p>
"There are countless instances of people being
buried alive," continued Mr. Carmichael.  And,
after racking his brains for two, cited them in clear
convincing tones.  Ferlie had scooped the last grains
of melting sugar out of an empty cocoa-cup and
thoughtfully left the room.  Mrs. Carmichael vaguely
hoped that God was not listening to the conversation
and then forgot all about it.  So did Robin.  Ferlie
remembered.  Always at night in this England,
deprived of her patiently crooning Burmese nurse,
she remembered.  The wigwam of sheets and
blankets was to shut out Fear.
</p>

<p>
She knew the footsteps on the stairs which were
coming to the rescue now; though he was not, in
his customary accomplished fashion, taking two
steps at a time.
</p>

<p>
"Is that you, Cyprian?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, old lady."
</p>

<p>
"I thought it might be Satan."
</p>

<p>
"Why Satan?"
</p>

<p>
She came out of her fastness with a shudder.
</p>

<p>
"They call him the Prince of Darkness, you
know.  This is the witching hour when I think he
probberly might..."
</p>

<p>
"Might what?"  Vainly he tried to sort the
tumbled bed-clothes.  Her Viyella night-dress was
dripping wet.
</p>

<p>
"Might take an' bury me in the Tomb," said
Ferlie in a hoarse whisper.  Cyprian tried to make his
laugh aggressively reassuring.
</p>

<p>
"Who on earth suggested such nonsense to you?"
</p>

<p>
"It can't be nonsense if it's in the Bible.  An' in
a book by a man named Hudson.  He makes the
kitchen soap 'cos Cook told me so when I asked.
He must be clever for every person to buy his
soap.  An' he buried Lazarus."
</p>

<p>
It was beyond Cyprian's power to disentangle
her from this web.  The servants must have been
frightening the child.  It was common knowledge
that the best of nurses were often grossly imaginative.
</p>

<p>
He stroked the russet mop of fluff resting against
his shoulder and resorted to practical conversation.
Except that it concerned her own private affairs
and was therefore connected with Teddy-bears,
the duck-pond in the park, the little-girl-next-door,
and other important personages of summers six to
ten, it was conducted as gravely as though they
were of an age.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian did not really understand anything about
talking down to a child's level and that was why
Ferlie loved him.  She detected the simple sincerity
behind his sometimes complicated language and
when he used words beyond her ken it was seldom
she failed to grasp the drift.
</p>

<p>
Neither the child nor the man realized that each
being sensitive to a fault, they affected one another
atmospherically and their true conversation existed
in emotions experienced side by side rather than in
sentences interchanged.  Thus, to-night, her quick
intuition arrived at the cause of that veiled look in
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to be married to that Vane
girl?" she enquired, betraying instantaneously to
Cyprian that there were those who disapproved of
his matrimonial projects.
</p>

<p>
He answered, "No," quietly, after an instant's
pause.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" asked Ferlie suspiciously.  "Nurse
says she's a hussy."
</p>

<p>
"No one should have said such a thing to you."
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't to me: it was to Rose.  Rose used
to live in her house, an'..."
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't matter what either Rose or Nurse
says," said Cyprian.  "But who told you about my
marrying anyone, Ferlie?"
</p>

<p>
"I think that was just in my head," struggling
to remember where the impression had first indented
itself upon her responsive brain.  "Why aren't
you...?"
</p>

<p>
He saw there was no help for it and replied
patiently, "She does not want to marry me; that's
all."
</p>

<p>
"Then she's a dam fool," said Ferlie with
complete conviction.  He was genuinely shocked.
</p>

<p>
"You must never say that of anyone, dear, even
if you don't like them."
</p>

<p>
"Dad says it of mostly all peoples, whether he
likes them or not."
</p>

<p>
"That's different."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"He's grown-up."
</p>

<p>
"How can grown-ups...?"
</p>

<p>
"And he's a man," Cyprian went on, desperately
aware that he was not doing very well.  "Ladies
don't use such words."
</p>

<p>
Then Ferlie played her trump card.  "Miss Vane
does," she said coldly.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian preserved a masterly silence.  Good
gracious! she was modern enough, of course.
Muriel!  There was music in her name ... and in
her throat when she sang ... and in the delicate
hands moving over the keys of the grand piano
downstairs; for she always played to them after
dinner in the evenings.  She had the whitest throat
he had ever seen and the most beautiful hands.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Why</i> do people always want to marry other
people?" insisted his companion, alive to mysteries
unsolved and femininely peevish in consequence.
Cyprian considered this himself before attempting
to clear it up.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose they grow lonely living just for
themselves," he said at last.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe that there girl would make
loneliness feel better," declared Ferlie.
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand, dear."  She cuddled his
sleeve, ecstatically sympathetic with that which she
<i>did</i> understand, his tone of voice.
</p>

<p>
"Are you so sorry you can't get married, Cyprian?
Why not make Miss Cartwright marry you astead?
She'd do it, I daresay, 'f I begged her for <i>my</i> sake.
She says she'd do most things for me, only not run
upstairs backwards at her timerlife.  An' she cooks
lovely choclick fudge.  Miss Vane can't, I'm sure.
You ask her."
</p>

<p>
"I think you are probably right about that."
</p>

<p>
"Then we've settled it," much relieved.  "I
wouldn't go marrying anyone myself 'less they had
a hand for fudge.  I'll tell Miss Cartwright to-morrow
that you want to get married to her this directly
immejantly, an' I was to ask her not to say 'No'
like Miss Vane."
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" exclaimed Cyprian rousing himself.
"I beg your pardon&mdash;I mean&mdash;you must never
say that, Ferlie.  But neither must you say anything
to Miss Cartwright.  Promise!  It's just&mdash;you see,
this must be a dead secret between you and me,
about Miss Vane and all."  Happy thought!  He
might trust Ferlie to the stake with their numerous
unique secrets.
</p>

<p>
"But, Cyprian, why..."
</p>

<p>
"Dear, my dear," said the man, speaking more
to the beauty of her upturned face than to the child,
"when you want to marry it is only the one person
who counts.  The one person with all her faults
and weaknesses&mdash;because those, too, are part of her.
Chocolate fudge (and there are more kinds of that
than you know) doesn't come into it with the
averagely decent man.  You just love the person or
you don't.  You will understand all about it some
day, when you are older."
</p>

<p>
The comforting arms which stole round his neck
might have understood all about it now.
</p>

<p>
"Do you really love that Miss Vane?"
</p>

<p>
"Heaven help me, I do!"
</p>

<p>
"Can't you stop if you want to?"
</p>

<p>
"Apparently not; but one doesn't want to.
That's the ridiculous part ... the thing grips
you, like invisible iron hands, to drag you along
a road of withered flowers, forcing you to breathe
the rot of that Dead Sea fruit which fills the air with
the bitter fumes of jealousy and passion....
Fruit?"
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian, didn't you not bring me up a cryssalized
apricot?"
</p>

<p>
He nearly chuckled as he stumbled back along
his "withered paths" to Reality.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, Little Thing.  I forgot.  You shall have
a whole box to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't get a moment's peace to eat them
unless we have it as a secret," she suggested
wheedlingly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" he cried, delightedly hugging her,
"You'll be a woman so much too soon."
</p>

<p>
"Mother says..." she began dreamily, and
that reminded him.
</p>

<p>
"She said I was to tell you to go to sleep at
once."
</p>

<p>
"Such a silly sort of thing to say to a child!"
said Ferlie, palpably quoting, "Sleep is like that
marrying feeling of yours: it can't be made to go
or stop ... Cyprian..."
</p>

<p>
"Well!"
</p>

<p>
"You did a wriggle.  You aren't goin' away."
</p>

<p>
"Not if you'll shut your eyes," he undertook
feebly.  "But, you know, there is really nothing to
be afraid of, Ferlie, whether I am here or not."
</p>

<p>
She knew better.  "And that's another thing you
can't let go nor stop, neither," she told him.
</p>

<p>
Considering it, with her head growing heavier
every moment against his shoulder, Cyprian came
to the conclusion that she was right.  The darkness
deepened about them as someone shut the door
between hall and stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian."
</p>

<p>
"Dear."
</p>

<p>
"Whoever you get married to, you will always
like me best, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course," said Cyprian.  "Of course..."
</p>

<p>
Her breathing became contentedly regular.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Downstairs, Muriel Vane had been very clever
at his expense.
</p>

<p>
More like a siren than ever, perched behind the
looming rock of the grand piano, a few gleaming
threads of escaping hair picked out against the
background of polished wood, while, every now and
again, her fingers rippled the accompanying chords
of some haunting French song.
</p>

<p>
She usually sang in French.
</p>

<p>
"To shock folk in legitimate ignorance," she
informed Captain Wright, leaning over her with
every symptom of shortly shedding his bones in the
vicinity.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Muriel!" placidly reproved Mrs. Carmichael.
She did not understand sung French, or
for that matter, any but the brand which, by dint
of firm repetition, brings you your hot water and
"Du thé&mdash;pas chocolat.  Pas!" in Parisian hotels
at eight a.m.
</p>

<p>
Muriel's sort of French was of little use to anyone
but foreigners, and there were so seldom foreigners
present.
</p>

<p>
"Sing 'Sanson et Dalila'," begged the Hon. Mrs. Porter,
feeling surer of her ground when dealing
with passion in opera, where, however unbridled,
it remained respectably unconvincing to the mind
of the British matron.
</p>

<p>
"I was saving that till Cyprian Sterne had finished
rocking the cradle upstairs," said Muriel.  "It
happens, quite unsuitably, to be his favourite song,
and the hand that rocks the cradle rules the girls&mdash;in
that its action suggests a future peacefully free
from that domestic duty for them."
</p>

<p>
"I have sent up two messages," Mrs. Carmichael
anticipated her husband plaintively, "but he replied
that he was not feeling very well to-night and would
join us after dinner."
</p>

<p>
"I have repeatedly said&mdash;&mdash;" began Mr. Carmichael,
but was firmly interrupted: "I know
you have, dear, but if half an hour with Ferlie
amuses him, I think it would be better to leave
him alone to-night."  She looked across,
meaningly, at Muriel and closed her lips.  Tact was a
thing nobody seemed able to acquire who had not
been born with it.
</p>

<p>
Muriel made a little grimace and burst suddenly
into a very simple melody:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "J'ai pris un bluet Fluet<br>
  Enclos parmi l'herbe<br>
  Et quelqu'un m'a dit; Mon Dieu!<br>
  Il n'est pas de bleu plus bleu<br>
  Que ce bleu superbe.<br>
  Moi, qui sais ce que je sais&mdash;<br>
  J'ai souri sans lui rien dire<br>
  Car à tes yeux je pensais&mdash;<br>
  Sans rien dire, sans rien dire."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The notes quickened with heartless mirth, and the
pure voice rang out again:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Au rosiers fleuris j'ai pris."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Mrs. Carmichael, ruminating that the piano, at
any rate, kept Muriel out of mischief, here clutched
thankfully, decided that the song concerned roses,
and framed an intelligent appreciation, on that
hypothesis, against its finish.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian walked into the room as the last verse,
reckless with desire, was sweetening the air:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "J'ai pris un pavé, trouvé<br>
  Au fond de cratère<br>
  Et quelqu'un m'a dit, Mon Dieu!<br>
  Plus dur pavé ne se peut<br>
  Trouver dans la terre.<br>
  Moi, qui sais ce que je sais&mdash;<br>
  J'ai pleuré sans lui rien dire,<br>
  Car à ton cœur je pensais&mdash;<br>
  Sans rien dire...  Sans rien dire...."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I always like songs about flowers, don't you?"
queried their hostess of the world.
</p>

<p>
And "Here you are at last," her husband
remarked to Cyprian before Muriel's curving lips
could make the most of that joke; "you really
should not spoil Ferlie."
</p>

<p>
"She is such a highly-strung child," the
Hon. Mrs. Porter volunteered languidly, waving a
gold-tipped ostrich feather, though, had she stopped to
consider the matter, she would have discovered that
she was cold in her chair near the door.
</p>

<p>
"Never yet," said Colonel Maddock, who adopted
the criticizing privileges of an unofficial uncle in
the house, "have I met the fortunate mother whose
children were not exceptionally highly-strung.  What
does the term mean exactly?"
</p>

<p>
"That they need a disciplined existence," said
Mr. Carmichael.  "All these modern methods of
making things easy for children are wrong.  Life
is not easy.  They must be fitted to overcome
difficulties."
</p>

<p>
"Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control!"
mocked Muriel, with accusing eyes on Captain
Wright who was trying to press her hand behind the
music-stand.  "I cannot bear a man, particularly,
without self-control; and the child is father to the
man&mdash;in Ferlie's case."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian dejectedly decided that he had let himself
go, rather, at the scene of the proposal.  She
had looked so infinitely desirable.
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie was frightened," he said, rather lamely.
"I think, perhaps, the servants&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There!" cried Mrs. Carmichael.  "What did
you tell Robin about English servants?"
</p>

<p>
"You should discipline her out of being
frightened," declared Muriel.  "Why make it easy for
a child to go to sleep with night-lights and such
nonsense?  Think of all the insomnia she will
have to battle against in future years.  Let her
learn to overcome&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carmichael was looking so stiff that his
wife intervened.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Muriel!  You do talk such nonsense.
Robin did not mean that."
</p>

<p>
"No?"  Muriel turned limpid eyes on Cyprian.
"And what line did you take with her?"
</p>

<p>
"We talked a little," he said, blinking quickly
at the carpet, "and presently she fell asleep.  I
must thank her for affording me the excuse to get
rid of a slight headache."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you were not yourself at dinner,"
said Mrs. Porter forgivingly.  "You are fond of
children?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Cyprian, somewhat bluntly.  He was
not fond of children.
</p>

<p>
"Really!  Ferlie is so devoted to you."
</p>

<p>
"She is about the first child I have ever
addressed, and will probably be the last."
</p>

<p>
"If she were a normal specimen, the first time
you addressed her <i>would</i> have been the last," said
Muriel, "I have heard you doing it.  I am glad
when you are with me you talk down to my level,
Cyprian.  I have not Ferlie's pristine trust in
dictionarial expressions.  I should imagine that
you were swearing at me half the time."
</p>

<p>
"I think he talks very good English," said
Mrs. Carmichael kindly.  "We none of us speak enough
like books these days."
</p>

<p>
Mabel Clement who, during the greater part of
the evening had been scrutinizing Muriel and Captain
Wright with a view to working them into her new
satire, "The Man-Eater," came out of a frowning
wilderness of thought, wherein the others had
completely forgotten her, to say that the ideal
language, as yet unborn, should consist merely
of a riot of sound, expressing the emotion it was
required to convey.
</p>

<p>
"Our spelling is execrable, our grammar clumsy,
and the elegant diction of the one-time popular
novelist of the Jane Austen calibre was affected in
the extreme.  Life is too short for these chains
of superfluous sentences, and far too short for us to
master all the tongues of Babel before we can test
the mentality of other nations.  It should be possible
to invent a tongue, common to all, conveying to the
brain, by sound, what it is desired to express."
</p>

<p>
"Let's begin to invent it now," Muriel suggested
rapturously: "Colonel Maddock!  Whu-u!  Why!
Whu-u-u!  Isn't my meaning perfectly clear?"  She
tilted her flower-face up to his, drawing in her
breath in a series of staccato jerks.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel grinned down amiably as he inhaled
the fragrance of a delicate hair-wash.
</p>

<p>
"I know!" Captain Wright bawled triumphantly
from his corner: "she wants a drink!"
</p>

<p>
In the storm of merriment which followed, Mabel
Clement smiling resignedly, retired again into the
fastness of her soul, while Cyprian crossed the room
to a tray containing, Eastern fashion, several long
bottles and a syphon.
</p>

<p>
While the party were breaking up in a fizzling
glitter of glasses, Mrs. Carmichael drew close and
gently touched his sleeve.  Then and there the
memories were blotted out of occasions when he had
wondered how a clever man like Carmichael stood
her!  Madonna-sweet, her smile at that moment.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a bit after the others leave," she said in
an undertone; "Robin and I have been wondering
about your plans.  And I want to consult you over
Ferlie's school."
</p>

<p>
The note on which the last word was spoken
broke in two.  When she and her husband returned
to Burma they would be minus encumbrances.
Subtly conveying her own need of a little sympathy
in the only idiom she knew, Mrs. Carmichael
remained unaware that in so doing she represented to
Cyprian the beauty of the Essentially Feminine.
</p>

<p>
She kissed Muriel "Good night," reflecting
cattily how boring women's kisses must seem to her
after ... and staved off the Colonel's last broad
approach to the forthcoming pleasure-cruise in the
yacht.
</p>

<p>
"Good night, Mrs. Porter."
</p>

<p>
"Good night, dear.  Such a pleasant...  Yes,
thank you, that is my vanity bag, though at my time
of life you may well be wondering ... and Muriel
with a Vinolia complexion has no business to own
such a thing."
</p>

<p>
"Robin, will you...  Ah!  Here is the parlour-maid...."
</p>

<p>
A low-murmured plea from Captain Wright,
whose arms encircled Muriel's cloak....  The
diamond glitter of answering eyes....
</p>

<p>
Good night....  Good-night.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
"Seems almost a pity," said Mr. Carmichael.
</p>

<p>
His wife looked her grey-eyed agreement.
</p>

<p>
"The one post promises security for life, a
fixed salary...."
</p>

<p>
"And is so eminently your line, Cyprian."
</p>

<p>
"At the moment," said Cyprian, "a secure haven
and a tranquil time to brood upon my good fortune
in it are the last attractions the world can offer
me.  I feel restless.  I know I am probably being
a fool but, since my mother died, there is nothing
that need prevent me from being a fool if I so desire."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carmichael had a feeling that any young man
who rounded off his sentence with, "if I so desire"
at this stage of his career, was intended by Heaven
for a University donship and not the vicissitudes of
a miner's existence.  She was quite right.
</p>

<p>
"The Company which has offered you the post
of Secretarial Manager and What-Not of
its&mdash;er&mdash;machinations," went on Mr. Carmichael, "will, in
all likelihood, burst before the year's end and leave
you stranded.  The Burmese mines are overdone
and I hardly believe in this new discovery and
your avaricious expectations.  What is promised?
Rubies?"
</p>

<p>
"I got such a pretty aquamarine straight from
the Mogok mines once," murmured his wife,
"through a friend who ..."
</p>

<p>
"You won't find any rubies, ten to one," warned
Robin.
</p>

<p>
"But I may find something else again which is
of even more importance to me," said Cyprian.
</p>

<p>
Neither of his companions asked what that was.
He went on slowly: "Some force outside myself
seems to be urging me away from England for
the present.  I fear the facetious would describe
me as a quitter, but, for certain natures, it is
always safest to quit ... temptations.  I have
never dared to do anything else myself, and a
superficial peace at Oxford just now would
multiply mine unbelievably, though I am sensible of
the honour done me by their offer of the appointment."
</p>

<p>
"You are only twenty-eight, are you not?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  For a humble tutor and lecturer to get
such a chance..."
</p>

<p>
"Free house and garden," chirped Mrs. Carmichael,
seeing womanly visions and dreaming
womanly dreams, "and with prospects of becoming
a master in time.  What a pity..."
</p>

<p>
She knew, alas, that Muriel would refuse to be
dazzled.
</p>

<p>
"Well, since you seem to have made up your mind
to throw up a good thing for a doubtful
one"&mdash;Mr. Carmichael never wasted time on vain regrets&mdash;"I
agree that your science and geological knowledge
will be invaluable to your employers and I had better
tell you what I have seen of the district."
</p>

<p>
The talk drifted into generalities, and Mrs. Carmichael
began to price Ferlie's winter coat and
remind herself to impress it upon the matron at
Peter's school that Peter was really an Exceptional
Boy.  She believed in a private appeal to the only
woman in an establishment full of unimaginative
men.  Pictured the red-roofed bungalow in Rangoon
without the children's toys annoying her husband in
the verandah.  Remembered all the other Colonial
mothers and wondered why that made the pain
worse instead of better.  Rejoiced that she had,
at least, got the better of Robin in the matter of
Ferlie's education.  None of your hard modern
schools, over-developing brain and body at the
expense of femininity.  Reaction must set in soon
on this count, and Muriel Vane was nothing if not
a warning.  There could come a revival of the
old-fashioned home-school, where it was so fortunate
that the kind Miss Maynes had welcomed the thought
of having Peter for the holidays.
</p>

<p>
They could not have agreed to take just any boy,
they had told her&mdash;in fact none had, up to date,
been offered them&mdash;but, in the circumstances,
"Why, it is really our <i>duty</i>, dear Mrs. Carmichael."
</p>

<p>
Yes, Lady Vigor's daughter had always remained
with them and, naturally, they had taken her to the
seaside.  How impossible, thought Ferlie's mother,
to have entrusted Ferlie or Peter to Aunt Brillianna.
</p>

<p>
Brillianna Trefusis, a maternal aunt of Robin's,
who was, nevertheless, not more than five years his
senior, was an eccentric lady who travelled a great
deal, spoke boldly and wore a disconcerting air
suggesting that life amused her.  And she did not
go to church!
</p>

<p>
Mused Ferlie's mother, it was all very well for the
men-folk to content themselves with prayer by
proxy, reaping where their loyal wives had sown,
but if the women were also to desert the old and
tried paths to that Better Land, Far, Far Away,
the chances were that the Judgment would fall due
before anyone had reached those Eternal Bowers,
and the travellers find themselves shooed into Outer
Darkness to the tune of "Depart, ye Cursed!"  And
Ferlie was so responsive to her surroundings:
Aunt B. could easily have raised doubts in her mind
as to the authenticity of Lazarus and Jonah, and
when once you began to pick and choose...
</p>

<p>
"No, I am afraid she is still out in the park,
Cyprian.  What's that?  Crystallized apricots?
Oh, but you really shouldn't.  I could give them to
her when she comes in....  Well, if you will
... she's sure to be near the pond.  Thank you, Peter
is quite well.  So odd!  He says his form master
asked him where he had learnt the secret of perpetual
motion.  Such a silly sort of thing to say to a child."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian had never met the exiled Peter, on the
occasion of whose swift banishment he had first
recognized a kindred spirit in the Ferlie, white-faced
and dumb, presented to him in the Carmichaels'
drawing-room with the motherly rebuke, "And,
Cyprian, this is the one I intended to ask you to be
godfather to, only Robin put me off, insisting that
you would not know what the term meant."
</p>

<p>
He visualized Peter, after winning his sister's
confidence, as a wiry mortal of nine summers,
permanently unlaced boots and an enquiring
expression; this last suggesting a soul too perfectly
in tune, if not with the Infinite, at least with the
Infinitely Annoying, as connected with problems
of Eternal Research, for the peace of mind of those
in charge of him.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it funny, when you come to think of it"&mdash;thus
Mrs. Carmichael when Cyprian had gone&mdash;"that
a woman's 'No' can alter the whole course
of a man's life?"
</p>

<p>
"Not nearly so thoroughly as can a woman's 'Yes,'
believe me.  He is jolly well out of that one."
</p>

<p>
"The trouble is that you can't persuade him of it.
Such an ideal situation for him, Robin.  A free
house and garden..."
</p>

<p>
"Nice Society," went on Robin, a little grimly,
"church bells within ear-shot, so that one can imbibe
atmospheric religion from an arm-chair, and the
golf-links closed on Sunday.  But you're right:
it would have suited him&mdash;in the end.  If ever I
saw an Oxford don in embryo, it is Cyprian."
</p>

<p>
"He's so Nice," his wife lingered over the word.
"One realizes at once how high-principled..."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's all that ... and he listens to the Abbey
organ regularly."
</p>

<p>
"Simple and obtuse," Linda Carmichael continued.
"And <i>she's</i> quite heartless.  Do you know,
Robin, sometimes she behaves almost as if she
were not a lady."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carmichael couldn't understand why Robin
sniggered at this superlative condemnation.
</p>

<p>
"She wants the Man-with-the-Stick," he briefly
summed up Muriel.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carmichael did not pursue that idea.  It
was so bluntly lowering to the dignity of Womanhood
as to make her feel mildly uncomfortable.  There
were wife-beaters in the slums&mdash;very sad&mdash;but she
always closed fastidious eyes to the thought that
among Us, also, the thing called Human Nature
could betray itself in crude unmentionable ways.
</p>

<p>
Exploited as it might be in these days, Human
Nature always seemed to her to have an undressed
sound.
</p>

<p>
Her own marriage had been a reticent affair:
separate dressing-rooms and so on.
</p>

<p>
There was something about Muriel, though her
father's first cousin was an Earl, which reminded
one of the pictures kept in the house because they
were classical but which one did not look at very
closely and hung in darkish corners of the landing.
Necessary to Art but hardly to Life.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
While Cyprian was laying in stocks of quinine,
dark glasses and thin pyjamas, and the Carmichaels
were busily embracing relations whom they never
set eyes on except at the "Ave atque Vale" occupying
the two separate ends of their four-yearly "leaves,"
and while Peter was interesting himself in illicit
Natural History during class hours, and Ferlie in
members of her own sex as a regiment, in class and
out, Muriel was brooding over her bones and finding
them tasteless.
</p>

<p>
She came out of her bath one morning after
washing her hair and, having given the damp cloud
a desultory rub with a large fluffy towel, tossed that
shield from her and paused before the long pier-glass.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And God, who made that body for delight"&mdash;<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
She quoted under her breath&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Should there have stayed and left a perfect thing,<br>
  Nor added to your loveliness a soul.<br>
  So had He spared you sharpest suffering;<br>
  Dark waves of night that o'er your spirit roll.<br>
  And sobs which shake you through the lonely night...."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Where had she read the words?  Some literary
magazine.  Author?  Hamilton Fyffe?  Was it?
Or Fyfe?  Remembered she had thought that clever
when, very young, she came across it.  Someone
had scrawled against the margin, "I fear me Fyffe is
very inexperienced.  No woman without a soul has
held a man for long."
</p>

<p>
Did she want to hold any man for long?  Did
she ever want to "fall in love"?  What bosh it all
was&mdash;this thirst of milk-blooded girls for the soul-mate.
</p>

<p>
"It's positively terrifying to see Truth naked,"
remarked Muriel to her own white reflection.  Or
was it not better to be free from mental corsets&mdash;as
well as the ordinary sort?  She raised herself on
tiptoes, clasping her rounded arms above her head
as the thought rippled into merriment across her
face: "If Cyprian were my husband and came in
now, accidentally, he would apologize and flee, and
be too much of a gentleman even to mention it
again on our meeting later.  He's the type of man
who would never forget that though its wife was
its wife she was still a 'lady'."
</p>

<p>
Footsteps, and a knock at her door disturbed these
cogitations.  A known voice greeted her through
it.
</p>

<p>
"May I come in, Muriel?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is that you, Twinkle?  Yes, so far as I'm
concerned you can come in.  Better leave your
gentleman-friend outside on the mat though&mdash;for
his sake, not for mine."
</p>

<p>
A thickset, handsome girl entered languidly, took
in the situation at a glance and sat down upon the
unmade bed.
</p>

<p>
"You are a One!"  Her voice drawled richly.
"I suppose I can smoke while you dress?"
</p>

<p>
"Puff away!  I'll have one too while I finish
my air-bath.  It fills me with optimism to take it
in front of the glass."
</p>

<p>
Twinkle ran critical eyes over this unbashful
nymph.
</p>

<p>
"You're all right," she said candidly.  "A bit
thin.  Thinking of posing as an artist's model?"
</p>

<p>
"Glory!  It never occurred to me."
</p>

<p>
"It's a possible treatment for your complaint,
my dear."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"  A deepening of the
carnation tint on Muriel's soft cheek.
</p>

<p>
Twinkle did not appear to notice.
</p>

<p>
"Enough eyes on your <i>tout ensemble</i> to satisfy
even your thirst for admiration.  The joy of seeing,
say, thirty individuals all occupied in reproducing
your beauty for general display in some gallery.
After-results ... <i>qui sait</i>?  The artist's model...."
</p>

<p>
"Meets artists," finished Muriel, recovering
herself: "I am out after bigger game.  I had thought
of going into training on your lines."
</p>

<p>
"The stage is over-stocked with people seeking
auditions who have not the slightest talent," warned
Miss Ruth Levine, commonly known as Twinkle,
probably because it was the most unsuitable
nickname that could possibly be found for her.  "You
<i>might</i> prove a happy exception."
</p>

<p>
"I'd get a walking-on chorus part, at any time,"
Muriel confidently assured her, "with nothing to do
but kick and use my eyes."
</p>

<p>
"M-m!  You've been reading some reliable
literature, wherein the pure-hearted Gladiola Trevelyan,
who is only on this degrading beat in order to
supply calves' foot jelly for little cripple sister Winnie
at home, finds the young earl's card in her dressing-room.
In real life you'll discover it is the son of the
local butcher who leaves his in a Rolls Royce and
that the marquises' cheques are to be mistrusted
more often than honoured."
</p>

<p>
"Truly enough, gold paint can disguise a lead
coronet.  We've one in our family&mdash;my second
cousin's.  Anyone is welcome to him for me.
Money I must have, Twinkle, or I may as well
commit suicide."
</p>

<p>
"You are doing that by inches while you waste
time emptying old pocket-books."
</p>

<p>
"My little weakness," admitted Muriel frankly.
"I take what comes while keeping my eyes on the
final goal."
</p>

<p>
"What the devil is your goal?  One man or
several?"
</p>

<p>
"You are an honest woman," laughed Muriel.
"I don't mind confessing for your private ear, that
I simply do not know."  She flung herself face
downwards on the tumbled satin quilt, cupping her
face in her pink palms.
</p>

<p>
"To look it in the face: I have seen marriage at
close quarters and found it distinctly uninspiring.
Father and Mother!  My God!  How they bore one
another!  They try to go their separate ways and
yet cling to a snarling respectability."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't they get a divorce?"
</p>

<p>
"Too expensive.  Besides, there is no just cause
or impediment.  I could forgive them if either had
risen to a guilty passion.  But that would have
smirched the family escutcheon, you see; merely
being rude to one another doesn't.  Then they have
not got me off their hands yet.  Dad would sell me
to the highest bidder to-morrow.  I am marketable
stock for some degenerate duke with no age-limit,
provided he is rich.  Not so easy to find, eh?  As
for a love-match with an impecunious captain,
whose inspiriting moustache bristles to touch one's
holy hand before the ring adorns it and, a year
later, remains quiescent against one's immovable
lip-salve&mdash;well, I ask you!  Every Sweet Young
Thing thinks her matrimonial drama will be acted
to muted violins in 'Just a little love, a little kiss,'
and is perfectly prepared to 'Give him all her life
for this.'  Now, I'm not."
</p>

<p>
"The alternative is a profession.  Mannequin?"
</p>

<p>
"Golly!  Not enough men in it.  And your
Model idea would have to be carried out in dark
secrecy.  Mother would poison me!"
</p>

<p>
"You carry out a number of things in secrecy
with complete success."
</p>

<p>
"Pff!  Not what you think.  I know my market value."
</p>

<p>
Twinkle's dark gaze became fixed and speculative.
"Any of your folk ever died in an asylum?" she
enquired suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you are being funny.  But, as a matter
of fact, my grandmother's sister did, and there was
an uncle, who gore-ily cut his throat, of unsound
mind.  Why?  Do I look as if I meditated such a
drastic solution of my problems?"
</p>

<p>
Twinkle decisively knocked out her cigarette and
stood up.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind....  Curiosity, I guess."
</p>

<p>
Muriel became dimly interested in this
dispassionate friend's disapproval of something.
</p>

<p>
"Do I fill you with disgust?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;with pity," was the unexpected reply.
"You don't understand what you are up against,
Muriel.  But I've seen types like you before; and
they are born, not made."
</p>

<p>
They went out together, presently.
</p>

<p>
"I have only got till lunch-time," warned the
actress.  "Matinee at two.  Performance again
at 8.30.  A dog's life!"
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't change with me!"
</p>

<p>
"Holy snakes!  I would not!"  Her vehemence
startled, for the moment, in one so remotely calm.
She pulled herself together as quickly.  "No, I
am fitted for my job.  Some day I shall be the
Big Noise all right."
</p>

<p>
Muriel glanced at the sure, emotionless face.  Not
pretty; La Gioconda, refined and Semiticized&mdash;if
one might use the word.  Beautifully tinted eyes,
heavy lidded and calculating, not for gain, but as if
their owner were perpetually weighing up the world
and did not, like Brillianna Trefusis, find it at all
amusing.
</p>

<p>
That Twinkle's distrait attitude at Marshall's
silk-stocking counter was due to Muriel's own
looming future the latter never guessed.
</p>

<p>
"I've seen 'em"&mdash;so ran the thoughts of the
Jewess&mdash;"always devoid of natural feeling at the start,
but unable to live without a man's eye upon them.
The market value of passion glibly at the tongue's
end.  Never sentimentally eroto-maniacal; better
if they were.  Then, suddenly, the day when the
craving for admiration merges into sex-realization.
No actual desire perhaps, for the love of an individual:
no realization of Love in the abstract as a desirable
thing.  A sudden startled awakening and, with
neither religion nor moral sense behind....  If
one could warn ... but there is always the chance
that I am misreading her and am utterly in the wrong.
She's no 'modern' product anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"Musings without method," remarked Muriel,
having lingered to reduce the youth at the ribbon-counter
to a state of drivelling imbecility with her
smile: "Are you meditating upon some subtle
gesture for your great act that will bring the curtain
down in a storm of sobs more soul-satisfying than
applause?"
</p>

<p>
"I was simply letting my mind run wild on the
subject of heredity as a factor in folks' lives.  There
are few things admitted heredity now except those
which are sexual, and I was wondering how far
the psycho-analysts had really got going on that
subject, apart from the sex-chart.  One has heard
of hypnotism as a cure at early stages for ... some
things."
</p>

<p>
"If I went to a hypnotist to be cured of anything,"
said Muriel, "what's the betting the gentleman
in the chair would find the positions reversed
and himself masquerading as victim?"
</p>

<p>
"I have no doubt you'd do your damnedest," said
Ruth, dryly.
</p>

<p class="thought">

</p>

<p>
It was not long before Cyprian sailed for the East.
</p>

<p>
Captain Wright, temporarily insane, though he
was the only one who did not know it, began to
drink at unusual hours.  Muriel had taken three
months to sicken of him and considered him
exceedingly ungrateful.  Weak.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian had shown himself much stronger.  He
went down to Ferlie's school to say good-bye to her.
</p>

<p>
"Like an uncle to the child, you know," her
mother had told the Misses Mayne; who beamed
over the avuncular visit, brooding on the Degrees
and reflecting what a good thing it might be should
he recommend the school while in the East.
</p>

<p>
"You will come back soon?"
</p>

<p>
"It will seem very soon, Ferlie."
</p>

<p>
"You promise, Cyprian?"
</p>

<p>
Nothing had ever succeeded in getting a respectful
prefix out of Ferlie, though Mrs. Carmichael was
uneasy lest the Misses Mayne should not feel quite
happy over the familiar mode of address.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I promise.  And I'll write if you will."
</p>

<p>
"I'll write," said Ferlie, "when I have things to
say."  A sensible resolution which might be more
widely adhered to.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian carried away with him the memory of
delicate hands, laughing eyes and a poignantly sweet
voice ... a memory which left the same ache
as does a solitary aloof star on a summer evening.
</p>

<p>
But always it was followed by the haunting comfort
of Ferlie's clinging arms.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
"French is to be talked from the time the rising-bell
rings in the morning to the time the dressing-bell
rings for supper at night."
</p>

<p>
So ran Rule 9, at St. Dorothea's Home School
for Girls.  It was relaxed on Saturdays at twelve
after the hour in the gymnasium.
</p>

<p>
At ten minutes to twelve the gloomy cavern,
known as the Glory Hole, rang with noise which,
according to the ancient series of L. T. Meade's
school-stories, stocking the library, should have been
punctuated with "silvery ripples of girlish laughter."  It
wasn't.  The parrot-house at the Zoo would have
been nearer the mark.  A harassed prefect presided,
noting the names of people who insisted on
forestalling the cuckoo-clock.
</p>

<p>
"Parlez-vous Français, Margery, ou je dirai
Mademoiselle."
</p>

<p>
"Ma foi!  N'est-ce pas que c'est douze heures?"
</p>

<p>
"Le cuckoo a cuckooé, je suis positive."
</p>

<p>
"Doris, vous sotte-ane, c'est ma place que vous
prendre."
</p>

<p>
Moods and tenses were blandly ignored at
St. Dorothea's outside the actual French class.
</p>

<p>
"Naw," denied Doris, resolutely blocking the
partition wherein she had thrust her own gym shoes.
"Je partage cet morceau de le shelf avec Ferlie."
</p>

<p>
"Mais, avant Ferlie, j'ai avez baggé!"
</p>

<p>
This last effort could not pass muster even on a
Saturday.
</p>

<p>
"Margery, 'bag' n'est pas Français et c'est
argot.  Prenez un point de conversation."
</p>

<p>
"Mais si je fait cela je ne peut pas jouez hockey.
Soyez une sport, Mary."
</p>

<p>
There was an understanding that whosoever lost
six marks during the week for failing to observe
Rule 9 was relegated to the ranks of the crocodile,
with the junior class of all, after lunch, instead of
being permitted to join in the usual Saturday games.
</p>

<p>
Margery was a constant offender; and the
Fourth Form A. were to play the Fourth Form B.!
</p>

<p>
"Si vous ne jouerez pas, ce sera un tiroir,"
prophesied Ferlie ingeniously, after pausing an instant
to consider the French for a "draw" at hockey.
</p>

<p>
The clock whirred.  "Cuckoo!  Cuckoo!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" said Margery Craven, piously.
</p>

<p>
The prefect fled, pretending not to hear.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you weren't playing either, Ferlie?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not&mdash;that's why I said if you can't play
centre-forward in my place the A's will be about
level with the B's.  You and I combined give the
A's the advantage."
</p>

<p>
"Why isn't Ferlie playing?" asked Doris Martell.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know?" and Margery's air was
fraught with mystery.  "The co-<i>rr</i>espondent from
Far Cathay has asked&mdash;and obtained&mdash;permission
to take the Favourite of the Upper Fourth to the
Zoo."
</p>

<p>
"Lucky little beast!"
</p>

<p>
"How long is he going to stop in England, Ferlie?"
</p>

<p>
"Only six months this time.  Father and Mum
never take such short leave, but Cyprian has had
malaria..."
</p>

<p>
"It's a beautiful name," mused Doris with
upturned eyes.  "No wonder she blushes!"
</p>

<p>
"Silly ass!"
</p>

<p>
"What beats me," said Margery, "is how Martha
and Mary allow Ferlie to gad about with a genuine
trousered male in an expensive tailored suit and all
the appurtenances thereof.  Because even if he
does look forty he's not really your uncle, is he,
Ferlie?"
</p>

<p>
"No, thank the Lord!  I shouldn't feel nearly
so comfy with him if he were."
</p>

<p>
"She confesses to feeling comfy with him,"
Margery informed the others.  "Brazen hussy!
And she a 'Sunlight Fairy'!"
</p>

<p>
Ferlie forgot Cyprian in a sudden righteous
indignation.  "You shut it, Margery!  Lot of
grinning shriekers!  Thought yourselves very funny,
didn't you?  You wouldn't laugh if it were your
mess."
</p>

<p>
For Ferlie's instinctive courtesy, rooted in a horror
of hurting people's feelings and combined with a
certain dreamy trustfulness in human nature,
characteristic of her, had landed her in a false
position which, during the past week, had been the
joke of the school.
</p>

<p>
A dean's wife, far-famed for excellent work
among the business girls of the suburbs, and
convinced that the road to salvation for all budding
womanhood lay via the fold of a Purity Society
organized by her, had now conceived the idea of
interesting the girls' schools in a campaign of mutual
prayer and interchange of friendly letters with these
unknown female correspondents of the working-class,
all virgin pilgrims up the Hill of Difficulty,
pledged not to permit male travellers to carry their
bundles nor waste their time in frivolous
communications.  The Misses Mayne, generally known to
their pupils, in terms of disrespectful affection, as
"Martha" and "Mary," approved of the plan
and accorded the dean's wife half an hour one Sunday
afternoon, following Bible Class, to set forth her
appeal for supporters in the school.
</p>

<p>
At the close of an earnest address she had suggested
that any of them willing to join the League
and correspond with another young woman, forlornly
in search of true friendship, would hold up a
hand.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie, having arrived late from an imperfectly
learnt collect, happened to be sitting at a front desk,
eschewed by early arrivals as too nearly under the
eye of Martha for perfect ease.  Not having paid
particular attention to the proceedings, but gleaning
from the speaker's tense expression that something
was expected of the school&mdash;possibly a penny a week
to the Blind Babies' Fund&mdash;she mechanically raised
her hand, wondering the while whether there would
be time after the Zoo to take Cyprian to that new
tea-shop where you could always get hot dough-nuts,
fresh and jammy.  Hers was the only hand raised.
The role of "Sunlight Fairy," by letter, to a factory
girl did not appeal to the Margeries and Dorises of
the Upper Fourth, and the senior school members
were struggling with finishing exams and wanted
no extra correspondence thrust upon them in their
scant leisure.  Had she only known it, the dean's
wife was about the fourth of a series of well-meaning
women that term obsessed with schemes for
benefiting England's blossoming womanhood.  To put
it coarsely, St. Dorothea's had "had some."
</p>

<p>
Margery was the most interested in Ferlie's future
radiance as a "Fairy."  The dean's wife, impressed
by such single-minded strength of character, had
invited her to tea and presented her with a blue card
depicting a rising sun shooting an inquisitive
searchlight on the face of a worried-looking young
woman wending her way up a crowded thoroughfare
either in quest of true friendship or a factory.
</p>

<p>
"And it's quite time you began," said Margery
severely, at the termination of Ferlie's bitter
harangue.
</p>

<p>
The bell for the reading of the week's marks
interrupted them; following which rite a strong
smell of Irish stew combined with apple pudding,
in the hall, did duty for a lunch menu.
</p>

<p>
And, "I will not eat the bottom bit of my suet
to-day," Margery resolved in a fierce whisper as
they filed to their seats.
</p>

<p>
The conversation over the gravied onions made about
four times the volume of sound as on a French day.
</p>

<p>
The Misses Mayne, one at each end of the long
table, beamed indulgently.  "Martha," the practical
one, who was also the junior of the two sisters,
confined her remarks to the state of the hockey field
and reminders that stockings were to be changed
immediately on the team's return.
</p>

<p>
"Mary" brightened life at her post by little
reminiscences of the ways in which she had spent her
Saturdays at school, "when hockey for girls was
quite out of the question, my dears," and the Magic
Lantern, with views of foreign countries in colours,
existed still as a delirious mid-term treat.
</p>

<p>
All went contentedly until the last helping of
apple pudding had been served out, and then Mary
settled her glasses and allowed her kindly faded eyes
to rest on one particular plate.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Margery"&mdash;a sudden hush followed the
raising of the gentle tones&mdash;"are you going to
conquer that pudding or are you going to let that
pudding conquer you?"
</p>

<p>
The luckless Margery, who had brought an empty
paper bag to lunch with felonious intent, started
guiltily and reddened to the forehead.
</p>

<p>
"You know it is by overcoming&mdash;always by
overcoming&mdash;the weaknesses in ourselves that we
develop into worth-while members of the world's
community," Mary continued.
</p>

<p>
"Or by coming it over other people," muttered
Ferlie, sympathizing with Margery's sensations
towards the grey mound of suet pushed to one side
of her plate.
</p>

<p>
"It&mdash;it always makes me feel sick, Miss Mayne,"
faltered Margery hysterically.
</p>

<p>
"Imagination!" came from Martha's end of
the table.  "How can good wholesome food make
anyone feel sick?"
</p>

<p>
Margery's mouth took an obstinate curve.  She
was not going to be intimidated by Martha,
anyhow.
</p>

<p>
That lady, with twenty years' experience of
Margeries behind her, probably sensed rebellion and
decided the moment had arrived for brisk
disciplinary methods.
</p>

<p>
"Eat it up, Margery, and don't be foolish,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
Margery sat very still.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the table did not want to witness her
downfall, nor seem, by respectful silence, to approve
the idiosyncrasies of Martha and Mary.  Why
should anyone eat the beastly pudding who did not
want to?  The fees were paid just the same.
</p>

<p>
Strained low-toned comments on the progress of
the new tennis court began to be heard; but Mary
was wiser than Martha, as of old.  Far wiser.  Long
and humble study of the New Testament had
inclined her heart to keep its Law.  She ruled, in
fact, by love.
</p>

<p>
"I think we'll leave it to Margery's own Brave
Self," she told her sister.  "She understands that
it is for her own good, mentally and physically, that
we desire her to eat it.  Do not distress yourself,
my child.  Just think the matter over carefully and
then decide which of your two natures is to Win the
Fray.  If, to-day, you decide to leave it..."
</p>

<p>
She smiled watery encouragement at Margery,
by this time incapable of eating anything.  Lunch
finished a little hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
Said Martha that night in the private sitting-room,
where she and Mary were wont to dissect characters
and debate the handling of them:
</p>

<p>
"A little giddy."
</p>

<p>
"But warm-hearted," defended Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Shallow," said Martha.
</p>

<p>
"It is a question of guidance, Sister," insisted
Mary.
</p>

<p>
Martha remained unconverted.
</p>

<p>
"Obstinacy must be dealt with firmly," she said.
"You will be at a loss next Saturday over the
apple pudding."
</p>

<p>
Came a knock at the door, and Margery stood
beside the tinted reproduction of the Good Shepherd
near it, looking at Mary over the stand crammed
with photos of dear departed pupils who, with
Youth's heartlessness, had supplied her, since, with
no other memories of their passing.
</p>

<p>
"I've decided to c-conquer the p-pudding,"
announced Margery.  And felt almost rewarded by
the spiritual ecstasy of affection in Mary's little eyes.
</p>

<p class="thought">

</p>

<p>
Cyprian did not recognize the sisters for the last
of a long line of sanctified Englishwomen who, in
the past, have run Happy Home-Schools for the
daughters of unmodern mothers, many of whom
lived abroad and who cherished the suspicion that
dear Daphne or Nora would not be prevented from
over-working to the detriment of her health at a
modern establishment which dealt in Oxford
examiners rather than in embroidery classes.
</p>

<p>
It was Ferlie who grew critical of the Miss Maynes's
curriculum, with the conclusion of her fourteenth
birthday, and so of their blatant efforts to coerce in
the straight and narrow way.
</p>

<p>
To Cyprian, the sisterless bookworm, the ladies
recalled his deceased aunts, a couple who belonged,
by rights, to a Victorian novel and at whose separate
funerals a special hearse had to be requisitioned for
the wreaths.
</p>

<p>
And all the flowers were symbolically white.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie, the out-reaching experimentalist, wondered
whether such of Cyprian's aunts as remained above
ground were exactly the type of people to direct the
electrical currents in a houseful of twentieth century
youth.
</p>

<p>
"Mary could have whistled for my brave and better
nature," she told Cyprian this afternoon, in relating
the incident of the pudding, with a resentment he
considered entirely out of proportion to the fact that
she had not minded the suet herself.  He admitted
that, as a sane man, he never ate things which he did
not like, nor did he know anybody who, having
attained years of discretion, believed such a course
necessary to salvation.
</p>

<p>
"But, you see, it must be difficult, Ferlie, to
legislate for so many tastes and, despite certain
things of which you may disapprove, the Misses
Mayne seem kind to you all."
</p>

<p>
"I think I could do with less kindness and more
common sense," she persisted, "and far less
prayer!"
</p>

<p>
He looked at the eager profile, bordered by a riot
of autumn-tinted curls, and wondered, a little
anxiously, whether Ferlie was growing up a sceptic
like her father.  And himself.  And most of his
friends.
</p>

<p>
He would rather she took both Testaments at
a gulp like a pill, in the unquestioning faith that
they would purge her as with hyssop according to
promise.
</p>

<p>
He recognized his attitude to be decidedly
illogical.  Perhaps the simplicity of Mrs. Carmichael
was not quite such a matter for humorous reflection,
after all.  Supposing the Woman-of-the-Future,
no longer sheltered from the rough and tumble of
things, began universally to don the materialistic
armour suited to her defence, and ceased to set her
marching song to the awe-inspiring chant:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "We love Thine altar, Lord;<br>
  Oh, what on earth so dear?<br>
  For there in faith adored,<br>
  We find Thy presence near!"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The singers might possess the undeveloped minds of
little children.  They might.  Nevertheless...
</p>

<p>
"They are such good women, Ferlie."
</p>

<p>
"I don't consider them any better members of
the world's community than you," Ferlie informed
him carelessly, adding, "and they have, according
to their ideas, much more to gain by being good."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian did not quite know what to answer.
A less humble man might have suspected that he
was fast becoming the child's ideal.  He only knew
that they cared a great deal for one another and that
Life, for him, seemed less meaningless, though more
unreal, when they were together.
</p>

<p>
He had chosen the Zoo because it was the nearest
open-air entertainment within reach, by tram, of
the suburb which contained St. Dorothea's, and
Ferlie was not, under Rule 6, allowed to attend
indoor places of amusement in term-time.  And
surely, at fourteen, it was a reasonable spot to take
Ferlie, the animal-lover, for recreation.
</p>

<p>
"But the tea here is beastly," she stated candidly,
and he undertook to follow where she should lead
when the hour for nourishment approached.
</p>

<p>
There were long stretches of walking between
the enclosures of the Big and Bloodthirsty caged
inhabitants which Ferlie favoured.  The two strolled
along contentedly, exchanging current news.
</p>

<p>
Presently: "You know she's abroad, Cyprian?"
</p>

<p>
"Really!"
</p>

<p>
"You didn't try to find out?"
</p>

<p>
"Not this time, Ferlie.  What's the use?"
</p>

<p>
Ferlie was frowning.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Brillianna asked me for a visit at Christmas.
And I went.  I like her.  She doesn't talk rot to me
just because I am not grown up.  She goes on like
you do.  And one wet afternoon another woman
came in and said that the Vane girl had gone abroad
after a nervous break-down, and Aunt B. said,
'Oh, that's what they've decided to call it?  The
uttermost ends of the earth would not effect a cure.'  And
I am telling you, Cyprian, because I feel that if it
means that she has been ill, you would rather know."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, old lady."
</p>

<p>
"But, Cyprian&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Dear!"
</p>

<p>
"I can't be a hypocrite about it.  I don't really
hope it is as bad as smallpox, but if anything does
make me hope that Martha and Mary's Day of
Judgment is true in every detail, it's her."
</p>

<p>
"But why, Ferlie?"
</p>

<p>
"If she came back would you ask her again
now?" she asked, ignoring explanation.
</p>

<p>
He revolved the possibility in his mind, seeking,
as ever with her, the meticulously accurate answer
her candid eyes deserved.
</p>

<p>
"I hardly know.  I have never met another woman
whom I wanted&mdash;that way.  But then, in my life
out East, I see very few Englishwomen, and they
are generally married.  I have guarded the thought
of her, as the Perfect One for me, so long in my
heart that, sometimes, I doubt whether any woman
could be all that one imagines her when one&mdash;cares.
It is not fair to endow your Ideal with the qualities
which suit you and then blame her for not acting
always according to your conceptions."
</p>

<p>
She walked on silently for some way with bent
head and her cheeks unusually flushed.  Then she
spoke again, rapidly.
</p>

<p>
"I have got to tell you, Cyprian.  From what
I have heard, now and again, I think that if you did
ask now, you&mdash;you'd get the answer you wanted
once.  There aren't a lot of men like there used to
be, and&mdash;and I don't understand what it is all about
but there is Something....  Well, anyway, you'd
stand a good chance now.  So I've got to tell you."
</p>

<p>
"You don't want me to take that chance, Ferlie?"
</p>

<p>
She turned her face from him, unanswering.  And
Cyprian incomprehensibly knew that he would never
seek out Muriel Vane with that question on his
lips; that her image would slowly drift out of his
dreams and that before it receded for ever he could
make no effort to call it back.  Could not?  Then
it was true that no man worshipped only at one
shrine in a lifetime?  It was the Ideal and not the
Individual to which he burnt his incense!  The most
startling part of this discovery was that nothing
mattered at the moment save that Ferlie would be
glad of it.
</p>

<p>
"As the years go by, one must change," he said
diffidently.
</p>

<p>
She drew a long breath and spoke nonchalantly
lest it should be interpreted as relief.
</p>

<p>
"She must be quite an old woman by now.  At
least twenty-six or twenty-seven."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian's laughter shattered the imperceptible
barrier of restraint.
</p>

<p>
"How old do you think I am, Ferlie?"
</p>

<p>
She surveyed him critically.  "Well, you are
never any particular age to me because, underneath,
I feel you are about mine; but the other girls don't
think you look more than forty."
</p>

<p>
"They are a little premature.  I am only thirty-five."
</p>

<p>
"It's a good age, you know," said Ferlie gravely.
"How terribly short Life is; over before you have
got anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"You think I have wasted mine, up to date?"
</p>

<p>
"It all depends on what you want in the end.
Do you know I have a feeling sometimes that we are
all just as much in cages as these animals, and can't
get out without breaking something.  The cages
Chance dropped us into when we were born.  Think
how enormous and how interesting the earth is!
And how much of it shall you and I ever see unless
we break away from the particular bits we are
imprisoned in?  Just look at that old lion.  He
has settled down, quite pleased, forgetting that there
was a time when he, or his ancestors, walked where
they wished for miles in the jungle.  And a lot of
us copy him.  Satisfied in captivity because it is
comfortable.  We don't remember what it was like
in the days of our freedom but common-sense tells
us it was unsheltered and unsure.  My ancestors
may have been gipsies and, if I had the courage,
I might be one again by breaking things.
Ordinarily, Martha and Mary have got me till I am
seventeen; then it will be some finishing place in
France for a year, and then Mother comes home
and I shall be considered luckier than most girls in
squeezing a Season or so out of Burma before Dad
retires."
</p>

<p>
"During which you will marry, Ferlie, and settle
down like a well-behaved little lioness and..."
</p>

<p>
"Live Mother's life all over again for her&mdash;ugh!"
</p>

<p>
She stared at the lion.
</p>

<p>
"No I shan't.  It can stay there if it likes, and
all the other fool-animals who don't know their
own strength.  I've got some inkling of mine.  I am
going to get out of the cage."
</p>

<p>
A passing keeper warned her not to shake the
bars and not to go so near, Miss.
</p>

<p>
She ignored him, clinging fervently to her subject.
</p>

<p>
"That old elephant could turn the howdah off
his back, kill at least twenty people and overset
the monkey-house inside quarter of an hour.  And,
instead, he just walks stupidly up and down, up and
down."
</p>

<p>
"Please don't put ideas into his head in passing,"
begged Cyprian.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he's only an animal and so would misuse
his regained power.  But a man needn't," said
Ferlie, hot-footed on the trail of great discoveries,
"a man needn't...  Are you happy, Cyprian?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I've hardly thought about it."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to have thought about it.  You have
been thirty-five years in a world where there is
unlimited happiness and unlimited misery.  And you
haven't yet decided which you want to choose:
Spring days, and stars, and the smell of the sea,
and flowers, and experiments in queer forces
electrifying every creature that lives and breathes,
or somnambulisticism ... listen, I made that word
up, I think&mdash;in a stuffy old cage, the bars of which
are conventions which ought to be broken into
smither&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie, you are making that lion angry by
beating the umbrella on his bars."
</p>

<p>
"He can have it if he wants it," she said, hurling
it into the cage.  "Martha made me bring it because
she knows I hate carrying one.  Said you always
knew a gentlewoman by the make of her umbrella.
I should think that anyone having to carry a
special sort of umbrella to prove her gentility must
be&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" exclaimed Cyprian as the lion
crunched through silk and spokes, roaring insults
at Ferlie the while, "Do come away.  The keeper
is on his way back here and everybody is looking
at us."
</p>

<p>
Everybody is looking at us!  That last truth
would have vexed him more but for the tolerant
amusement on the face of a lady standing near
them.  She seemed past middle age and indifferent
to the fact, being practically and severely costumed
in dark grey, while her iron-grey hair fitted so tidily
into her toque that one immediately divined it was
shingled.  She fixed Cyprian with a placid eye.
</p>

<p>
"The unfortunate lion," she said, "breaking
his teeth, like the rest of us, on an illusion
flung like a challenge at his head by Youth in
rebellion!"
</p>

<p>
Cyprian lifted his hat awkwardly in acknowledgment
of the remark, inwardly deciding, a little
acidly, that she might have realized he was, possibly,
as near Ferlie's age as hers.  But Ferlie, herself,
twisted about with a rapturous greeting.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's Aunt Brillianna!"
</p>

<p>
Aunt Brillianna accompanied them to the tea-shop,
picking up the thread of Ferlie's discourse
just where the end had blown loose.
</p>

<p>
"And when you have got out of your cage, Ferlie,
and are no more mentioned by the long-suffering
Misses Mayne, except in secret and grieving prayer,
and when you have trodden on your mother's heart
and taken unholy satisfaction in the fascinatingly
soft squelch of it, and when you have seen the iron
enter into your unbelieving father's soul on your
flat refusal to mate with the most promising and
dyspeptically desk-chained member of his service,
and when you have laid the foundations for a new
Utopia where everyone will find himself uncaged
and free and&mdash;if I mistake not&mdash;naked, will there
really be enough blue-birds in the trees to go
round?"
</p>

<p>
"You are only pretending to laugh at me, Aunt
B.; you know quite well what I want."
</p>

<p>
"Six eclairs, four dough-nuts, two cream-buns,
a strawberry-ice and a dose of castor oil," Aunt
Brillianna promptly informed the attendant in lace
cap and apron: adding with a scrutinizing glance
at her white face, "you look as if you could do
with that list and some over, yourself, my dear
child."
</p>

<p>
The tea-girl blushed and, reading sincerity in the
friendly smile, admitted that she had had a particularly
long day owing to Them being shorthanded.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," encouraged Aunt B., "I'll stand
you treat with this niece of mine, provided the
moment you get off duty you settle down to it at
any place where the cakes are not so well-known to
you as these."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian protested at her making herself responsible
for their own three teas.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be silly," she advised him, "I am quite
old enough to make a nephew of you if I wish.
Ferlie is my great-niece and it is quite useless to
try and hide the ghastly fact.  And I have quite
a lot of money scattered about in odd corners of
the earth.  Some day Ferlie shall have some to build
a Temple to her Freedom goddess or god.  She will
find, sooner or later, that the bars she objects to
are made of gold.  You ought to know that.  How
are rubies?"
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie has told you what I do?"
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie has told me much more of all you have
left undone.  Quite unintentionally she has painted
a portrait of you in your true colours.  I doubt if
you could paint her&mdash;or any woman&mdash;in hers."
</p>

<p>
"I hope the picture did not impress you altogether
unfavourably?"
</p>

<p>
"We are discarding the fallacy nowadays that
Love is blind," said Aunt B. inconsequently.  "While
young and clear-eyed it has excellent sight.  Later,
it takes to dark-glasses of its own choice, and so
gives an impression of sightlessness.  Ferlie knows
you better now than she ever will know you, Edward
... or, no, that's not the name&mdash;What is it,
Ferlie?"
</p>

<p>
"It's 'Cyprian,'" announced Ferlie from a bath
of cream and jam, "and you're frightening him
to death, Aunt B."
</p>

<p>
"Can't help that.  He's rather embarrassing me
by being so palpably embarrassed.  Don't blink
like that, Cyprian.  Are you young enough to join
Ferlie in those poisonous cakes or would you prefer
a scone?"
</p>

<p>
Cyprian coldly selected an éclair.
</p>

<p>
"Happy man!" said Aunt B., twinkling all over,
"The sweets of life are tasteless against my false
teeth.  A watercress sandwich, now..."
</p>

<p>
She was a startling contrast to Cyprian's
late-lamented aunts, influencing the life of Little
Puddington, even under their heavy slabs of marble,
by the trail of Guilds, Club-rooms, and Organ
endowments left behind them.  And Martha and
Mary would have said, with one accord, that a
woman's glory was her hair.  A wig, or at least, a
discreet frame, if not an actual transformation, would
be preferable to that shameless modern shingling.
</p>

<p>
Brillianna Trefusis was too obviously one of those
new elderly women who no longer found the Presence
on the altar of wood and stone, and as obviously was
Ferlie in love with her.
</p>

<p>
She caused Cyprian to leap finally in his chair at
this stage of his conclusions.  Intercepting his
interrogative glance at Ferlie, exceeding the Safety
First limit as to ice-cream, "You'll like me when
you come to know me better," Aunt B. assured him.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
When Ferlie was seventeen and a half, and the
finishing school loomed ahead with its extra music
lessons and picture gallery tours, Peter, too, began
to have ideas about cages.  He did not quite describe
them in Ferlie's way but proved himself worthily
her brother and, up to a certain point, allowed
himself to be influenced by her opinions.
</p>

<p>
At nineteen, when Caius College claimed him, he
showed signs of forging ahead at a pace which left
her a little breathless.  The enquiring expression had
sobered, on the development of a well-chiselled nose,
into the self-assured look of someone who has things
to tell the world.  To Ferlie he first imparted samples
of these.
</p>

<p>
His reform scheme for the suffering Universe
was to be based, of course, on psychics.  As a first
step towards bursting upon Humanity in the guise
of Universal Healer, he had taken Havelock Ellis
in large indigestible doses, concluding inflexibly
that all trouble dated, not so much from Adam and
Eve as from Lilith, who made of them Two, instead
of One, like herself.
</p>

<p>
"Originally, we were in all probability One Perfect
Sex," he told Ferlie.  "Artificial experimenting
caused the split, which, naturally, left one sex the
complement of the other.  We find the old allegory
of Jupiter dividing by sword the race of gods which,
having created, he had begun to fear.  Ever since,
each has been looking for its true half in order to
regain the lost power the Perfect Whole first
possessed."
</p>

<p>
"But surely the bi-sexual insects are the lowest
in the scale of Evolution," argued Ferlie, shrinking
somewhat from the suggestion that Peter's new
Heaven and Earth, amalgamated, would contain
no marrying nor giving in marriage.  Because,
though she, at fourteen, had pledged herself to
eternally single blessedness, she rather liked to see
other people marrying and driving away in their
best clothes, looking happy.  One never saw the
same people again, somehow, after they had driven
away.  The couple which returned in their place
seemed always to be a couple that asked nothing
better of life than to sit still.  The driving away
spelt Adventure but, perhaps, they came back before
they had reached that.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie was quite sure that, having once begun to
drive away, she would never turn back.
</p>

<p>
"And you see"&mdash;she had lost Peter and returned
with a jump to find him grazing in new pastures&mdash;"half
the hysteria at the back of crime and all
unhappiness is sexual.  The economic conditions
in this country which condemn so many women to
single cursedness are disgraceful.  And how can
anything vitally important be accomplished for the
Good of the Universe and the control of its illimitable
forces, when this sex-hunt, and natural procreation,
curtails such a disproportionate amount of human
time and energy?  The natural functions necessary
for the continuance of the Race should be exercised
almost as unconsciously as in the case of trees and
plants, without stultifying analysation of emotion.
It is time we strove for a simpler and less
sentimental Ideal..."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie agreed that everyone who wanted to get
married should be able to do so by means of a State
Dowry, equal for all, but she did not see how Peter's
Reform Scheme was to provide sufficient male mates
even then.
</p>

<p>
"And is it a doctor you will call yourself, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall be the First of my Kind," said Peter in
tones which admitted no doubt of it.  "Once through
the usual exams, so as to give the old-fashioned
geezers no handle&mdash;I have always felt Barker should
have tempered the wind to the shorn lambs of his
period&mdash;I shall strike out on Lines of My Own.
I shall not attempt to explain them to you yet.
But, first of all, there must come a Breaking Away!"  He
made a wide gesture with his arms, and Ferlie,
furtively sympathizing with this draw-a-long-breath
attitude, suspected that Peter would probably excel
himself in the Breaking Away, whatever happened
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
"I may have to deal a blow to many existing
institutions and suffer a bit for my convictions,"
went on Peter, looking as if this would not prove
the least enjoyable part of the campaign, "for
instance, Marriage must go."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, really, Peter?  I am rather sorry."
</p>

<p>
"It is a starkly barbarous survival of prehistoric
ages; and now half the people who uphold, or at
least weakly condone it, are making vows they do
not intend to keep before altars whose sacrificial
fires have long been cold."
</p>

<p>
He talked very well, thought Ferlie, and probably
did not mean all he said.
</p>

<p>
"But, Peter, do you really think that the majority
of people have stopped believing in God?"
</p>

<p>
"Few have stopped who ever believed.  Many
have never believed who assumed they did because
the Christian ethics were necessary to the civilization
which they found comfortable.  Scientific minds
are now demanding proof, and finding none, of
many things upon which those ethics are said to
be based.  Therefore they begin to have the courage
of their convictions.  Lack of that has, up to now,
caused them to accept marriage on the surface and
to deny it by secret act.  They have entered into
lying contracts which are not only against Nature
but against common sense, because they feared
to be pioneers.
</p>

<p>
"In all great movements there must be pioneers.
It's not a pleasant job, pioneering; nor is it for
cowards.  At present, my own brain refuses to admit
the existence of a Personal God, who can be cajoled
or roused to anger according to the behaviour of a
swarm of little ants on one of the countless millions
of whirling globes He is said to have made in His
spare time.  The Herd Law, developed by the
strongest of those little ants, is followed by the weak
majority under the guise of a Divine Law, until a
stronger little ant than the first one comes along and
amends it to suit himself, still sounding the Divinity
slogan.  Whatever name is given to this religion
or binding principle, the non-courageous part of
the Herd, which is the greater part, follow, etc.,
etc., and etc."
</p>

<p>
Visions of Peter followed by a Herd released
from lawful matrimony caused Ferlie an instant's
misgiving.
</p>

<p>
Of course it was admitted that the marriage
service had been somewhat unfortunately reformed
already once in the past by Cranmer, who, influenced
by German relatives, had introduced the Germanic
idea of servile obedience for the woman, absent in
the old Catholic form.  The modern Anti-Reformationists
were rightly demanding fresh revision and
omissions.  "Stronger ants," she supposed.  But,
if they proved less strong than the Peters, would
Free Love make a superior substitute to an
institution hitherto regarded as God-given, though
Cranmerized?  Even if God had become, for the
Scientific Mind, as obsolete as Cranmer?  Whoever
re-created two imperfect sexes out of One Perfect
Sex had made a very thorough job of it.  Besides,
were all Peter's ideas quite so shiningly new as he
touchingly considered them?
</p>

<p>
"You really have remarkable powers of assimilation
for your age," said Peter, "and, unlike many
women, are not hysterically upset by the Unobvious."  (Ferlie
hoped that Cyprian might, also, appreciate
these newly-developed qualities when he came home.)  "And,
therefore, I feel inclined to trust you with
an important secret."
</p>

<p>
"You know you can, Peter."
</p>

<p>
He braced himself for confession.
</p>

<p>
"I have met a woman," said Peter.
</p>

<p>
Somehow Ferlie had thought as much.
</p>

<p>
"Slightly older than myself," he went on.  "She
is a hospital nurse and, naturally, we have discovered
much common ground to explore in discussion.
The nurse, I always maintain, can form a more
accurate estimate of the patient than can the doctor.
Phyllis agrees with me that, in most cases, mental
control should be established first, and hypnotic
influence be given a more important place than
medicine.  The theory should be practised, not
talked about.  The advertisement earned by Coué
and Hickman and their friends, becoming mingled
with ridicule, injures their cause.  Jesus of Nazareth
avoided advertisement.  He wisely foresaw the
harm it did; and he never pretended to be doing
anything that a disciple could not also do who
sufficiently developed his will-power and
self-confidence."
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you won't talk like this to Martha and
Mary?  At present, you see, Peter, they think you
are so nice."
</p>

<p>
He waved a lofty hand at the mention of these
shorn lambs of his generation.
</p>

<p>
"I have told you I believe in tempering the wind."
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, although it was splendid to be
considered fully protected against the searching
elements of Truth, Ferlie felt that her wool might
have been thicker after his final announcement.
</p>

<p>
"Phyllis and I, likewise, see eye to eye on this
pioneering question.  We are convinced we have a
mission.  It shall be carried out, not by word of
mouth, but by example.  We suit one another.
We are healthy and, from a medical point of view,
know all there is to be known about contraception.
At present we meet in secret.  I feel I owe it to the
Old Folk to put my views squarely to them before
coming fearlessly out into the open to state that,
in the eyes of the God we serve, we consider ourselves
married without the intervention of a priest or State
official.  Phyllis has no parents&mdash;thank goodness!&mdash;to
bring pressure to bear upon her in the form of
hysterical tears.  We shall live together without
cheapening our private relationship by becoming
parties to a ceremony which, in our case, is
tantamount to a farce.  We shall remain faithful to one
another without the urge of a public vow, loyal
without the necessity of bonds to keep us so.  Should
we, eventually, decide to have children, they will
be brought up on like principles and taught the
utter unimportance of sex except for purposes of
healthy propagation, and it will be a point of honour
for each parent to do his, or her, utmost to fulfil
the responsibility entailed at their birth, uncoerced
by any Court of Law.  Since the whole union will
be based on reason, not sentiment, everything is
bound to run smoothly.  It is all very simple, really."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie knew that Cyprian would consider it
lamentably complicated.  And wasn't Cyprian a
little more experienced than Peter?  If Cyprian had
married Muriel&mdash;and an unaccountable coldness
stole over Ferlie at the thought&mdash;it would certainly
have been according to Herd Law, if not God's.
</p>

<p>
"You mean, Peter darling&mdash;<i>Do</i> you mean that
you are living with this woman now?"
</p>

<p>
"Please remember that you are referring to My
Wife, in the Eyes of God."
</p>

<p>
But Ferlie was considering the eyes of their
uncle, the bishop.  She wondered whether, as an
only sister, she had done her duty by Peter.  Mary
might be a stupid old thing but she was led to believe,
in spite of oneself, that she walked with God.
Inspired by this realization Margery had conquered
the pudding.
</p>

<p>
The Influence of The Good Woman was Mary's
favourite subject for a Sunday Talk.
</p>

<p>
Mankind, she would say&mdash;she never called
them "Men"&mdash;were uplifted by it, comforted in
sorrow, healed in sickness, converted on death-beds.
</p>

<p>
"A lady with a lamp shall stand, etc...."
</p>

<p>
Peter, despite his lordly airs, was slightly pinker
than usual and his eyes sought space above Ferlie's
head.  He had a beautiful skin, she thought.  She
did hope Phyllis was nice.  She knew that her mother
would have given up hope right away but, perhaps,
parents, and even Cyprians, were a little out of date.
</p>

<p>
The Young were marching onwards, still soldiers,
though not exactly Christian ones; because the
old Christian Leader was out of date too.  He was
now just Jesus of Nazareth, the Founder of
Christianity, as the Buddha was Gaudama Theiddatha,
the Founder of Buddhism, and Mohammed the
Founder of&mdash;was it Islam or Allah?
</p>

<p>
Said Peter, making a successful break-away from
a pause which threatened to become uncomfortable,
"I will introduce Phyllis to you, Ferlie; on the
Q.T.  We are relying on your support."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Peter," touched by this beautiful confidence
in her affection.  "Only I do hope you are
both quite sure."
</p>

<p>
She wasn't a bit sure herself.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Phyllis did nothing to decrease her uneasiness.
That lady proved to be pale-faced and regular of
profile, with quick dark eyes which never came to
rest on any one object for long.  Mrs. Carmichael
had a weakness for people who looked at you, as
she was in the habit of saying, "dead straight in
the face."  In thinking it out Ferlie remembered
that very few ever did.  Why should they?  And,
of those few more than one had been proved, later,
own brother to Ananias.  But, whether or no Phyllis
was own sister to Sapphira, she scarcely glanced at
Ferlie in shaking hands.  She might, decided Peter's
sister, be incessantly calculating sums in mental
arithmetic.  The fluttering of her eyelids apparently
shut out visions which sought to steal between her
brain and the addition and subtraction.
</p>

<p>
The interview was hardly a screaming success.
Ferlie was irresistibly and unreasonably reminded
of Muriel Vane and wondered, depressedly, on the
way home, if she were going to develop into one of
those women who mistrust their own sex.
</p>

<p>
She was Aunt Brillianna's guest at the time, and
the latter swiftly noticed her problematical silences,
but put them down to anxiety over the mail which
brought distressing news of Mr. Carmichael.  The
doctors talked sagely of an operation and he was
taking sick leave.
</p>

<p>
"If he should have to retire now he won't get his
'K,'" Ferlie reminded Aunt B., reading from her
mother's inconsequent scrawl.
</p>

<p>
Aunt B. dryly tendered it as her opinion that the
Family of Carmichael was great enough to survive
that loss.  "Leave us our nobility" had best
described her attitude since the Houses of Trefusis
and Carmichael had united.  The ancestral title
would ever carry more weight with her than any
that might possibly be earned or bought by some
Son of Trade with nothing to recommend him but
Board School brains or a Bank Balance.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie, however, received a clearer idea of the
workings of her mother's mind.
</p>

<p>
One returned from Exile with letters after one's
name, the reward of thirty-odd years of labour, and
in Europe people knew not what they meant nor even
the order in which to write them.  The Handle,
an unmistakeable sign of services rendered, they could
understand and respect, whether or no the man who
wore it had received the just reward of his deeds.
</p>

<p>
"Your father," wrote Mrs. Carmichael, "will be
the only one of the Family to have had his career
cut short, if this illness presages early retirement.
And this with you nearly grown-up and Peter
becoming more expensive every term...!"
</p>

<p>
Ferlie could have foretold that, apart from the
question of expense, Peter, at the moment, was
unlikely to exercise a soothing influence on his
mother's shattered nerves.  She had an idea that
Aunt Brillianna would prove the only satisfactory
exponent of his case, but Peter had not been moved
to confide in Aunt B.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
His parents came, heard, but found themselves
unable to conquer him.  Peter was a stauncher
supporter of truth than of tact.  His mother took
refuge in unlimited tears; his father in the only
ethics he favoured, i.e., those founded on the honour
of the House of Carmichael.  Decently-bred people
simply "did not do" these things.  Peter hotly
denied that his bodily functions were at variance
with those of the organ-grinder.  This was the most
unkindest cut of all.  No Carmichael had ever ground
an organ for a living and the comparison was odious.
</p>

<p>
Peter wanted to introduce Phyllis to them as his
wife in the eyes of whatever God the Family severally
worshipped.  His father adopted the time-honoured
attitude which forbade his son to bring That Woman
in contact with the crystal purity of mother and
sister.  Ferlie, holding to the view that "better a
little lie than much great unhappiness," refrained
from publishing it abroad that she had already
been subjected to the contamination of Phyllis.
</p>

<p>
Peter and his latch-key departed the house and
were no more seen, and his irate father's emotions
were presently smothered in a whirl of soft-footed
nurses and suavely-smiling physicians.
</p>

<p>
"If Peter could only have waited!" wailed his
mother.  But Youth waits on nobody.
</p>

<p>
Once free of the Nursing Home Mr. Carmichael
took a practical line: Peter found his allowance
stopped.  Then it was that he diabolically exemplified
his theories regarding the common Brotherhood of
Man by obtaining an organ and a particularly
chilly-looking monkey who danced to the tune of
"O solo mio," thus rendered by a Carmichael
outside the paternal library window.  No one could
have guessed how the farce would end.
</p>

<p>
The last act was exclusively organized by Phyllis.
The very opposition had lent Phyllis a fictitious
value in Peter's eyes and his philosophy became for
him the bread of life.  To Ferlie, alone, he brought
his accounts of Phyllis's unfathomable comprehension
of his own soul.  "Mixed into me as honey in wine,"
etc., etc.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis assumed the same proportions for Peter
as had Muriel Vane for Cyprian; she was the
Perfect Mate.  And then Phyllis met a well-to-do
surgeon, with reputation already established, who
was not merely ruling an ethereally beautiful Kingdom
in the Clouds.  To Ferlie came Peter, wild-eyed
and incredulous.
</p>

<p>
"But she said&mdash;But she <i>understood</i> that she was
My Wife," he repeated again and again, as if by
the repetition he could find the key to the riddle.
</p>

<p>
"And, you see, Peter," said Ferlie simply, "if
she had been married to you in the ordinary way&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But that was going ahead too quickly for Peter.
</p>

<p>
"She said...  She promised..."  Surely that
creed should be all-sufficient which admitted the
word of a mortal soul to be its bond.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carmichael's sense of injury against That
Creature for having caught Peter was now transformed
into indignation because she had let him go.
</p>

<p>
His father, the danger safely over, resumed his
man-of-the-world pose as though he had never
departed from it, produced an extra ten-pound note,
or so, and told his wife that boys would be boys.
</p>

<p>
Only Ferlie fully realized that by such means
boys become men.
</p>

<p>
Aunt B., meeting Peter accidentally soon afterwards
in the Tube, immersed in illustrated volumes
whose pages unblushingly revealed to his neighbours
on either side aspects of the human frame the existence
of which they had, hitherto, blandly ignored, nodded
her shingled locks in Sybillic understanding.
</p>

<p>
"Buses and Tubes are the most natural places
to study the shapes of one's fellow-creatures," she
remarked.  "I see you are determined it is to be
Medicine, Peter."
</p>

<p>
"Medicine must be the preliminary," Peter
replied, unshaken in his resolve to arrive at summits
unattained, albeit it seemed he would be obliged
to scale them unpartnered.
</p>

<p>
"I am going abroad for the winter," Aunt B. informed
him.  "I may, or I may not, return with
the swallows.  When Ferlie is in her Parisian convent
and you memorizing the seventeen Latin names for
the stomach, or some equally uninspiring anatomical
organ, in Caius, no one will be needing a garrulous
old woman who finds it difficult to keep her fingers
out of other folks' pies.  I suppose when I see you
and Ferlie again you will both have quite a lot of
advice to give me as to where I should ornament a
bath-chair for the remainder of my days."
</p>

<p>
If Aunt B. had been able to face the English
winter, or, if on deciding not to do anything so
disagreeable, she had left an address behind her
for regular correspondents to bombard with the
Family scandals, her departure might not have
affected Ferlie's whole future.  As it did.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Peter had come down for the Short Vacation
that Season, and Ferlie had clung in damp farewell
round the high collars of Martha and Mary, and
returned to town to lay in stores of more advanced
underclothing than had been permitted under
their care in preparation for her departure to be
"finished."
</p>

<p>
The fortnight after Christmas she spent at the
home of Margery Craven, now a red-cheeked Diana
of the hunting-field, collecting brushes and masks
of more than legitimate four-footed victims.
</p>

<p>
Thence, an unintelligible letter from Peter recalled
Ferlie.  It was so unusual for Peter to condescend
to anything longer than a telegram that Ferlie
took the train home with forebodings she tried
vainly to allay.  Something had gone wrong, he said.
Plans for everyone had altered and she was needed.
</p>

<p>
She reached their town house to learn from the
parlour-maid that her father had been taken back
to the Nursing Home; that her mother was with
him now there, at the moment, and that Mr. Peter
had ordered tea in the library.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie sought him without even waiting to shed
her muff and furs.  It was always rather dark in
the library, but the uncertain shadows cast by the
red lick of flaming tongues in the deep grate, where
a new log was crackling, could not altogether account
for an odd bleared look about Peter's eyes.  He was
sitting in a crimson leather arm-chair, his shoulders
hunched, his hands on his knees.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" he hailed her unconvincingly; and
he spoke as if he had a cold.  "I couldn't meet
you&mdash;had to do some important messages for
Mother."  Then he explained.
</p>

<p>
Even if Mr. Carmichael's second operation proved
successful, he would never return to Burma; in
which case Ferlie could not go to Paris, nor Peter
back to Caius.  It would be impossible for his father
to put him through the prolonged and expensive
medical course on a pension reduced by high income
tax, increased rates of living, and the expense of
interminable doctors' fees which they might have
to meet in the future.
</p>

<p>
The town house must, necessarily, be sold.
Mrs. Carmichael would feel most the change to cramped
quarters; she had been a Somebody among other
Somebodies in the East.  Moreover, out there, the
"K" was considered a foregone conclusion with
regard to her husband.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie's own disappointment receded into the
background as she measured the full force of this
second blow which Fate had dealt Peter.
</p>

<p>
"It will mean&mdash;&mdash;" she faltered after a long
pause, and stopped.
</p>

<p>
"Anything a fellow can get," said Peter, his
air-castles a blur of undefined hues at his feet like
the ruined rainbows of melted snow.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie wondered if it were true about the darkest
hour coming before dawn.  Wished that she could
hear Cyprian's views on the subject.
</p>

<p>
During the next few weeks, however, she found
herself consoling, rather than consulting, people.
Her mother and Peter were too immersed in their
particular aspects of the trouble to question whether
Ferlie herself did not require most support, freshly
transplanted as she was from a world devoid of
responsibility to one teeming with seemingly
unsolvable problems.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
"I suppose you had better go," said Ferlie's
mother.  "One had not intended you to 'come out'
so soon; but as it is impossible to tell what the
future will hold for any of us, it will be better for
you to miss no opportunity of meeting people and
making friends.  Peter will no longer be able to
bring men down from Cambridge for us to know."
</p>

<p>
That took her off on a different track from Lady
Cardew's dance invitation to Ferlie.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Peter," she said, "he looks so white and
wretched and I am sure the thought of his ruined
future is keeping your father back."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie said she had no heart for dancing.  She,
also, was looking white but as nothing had ruined
her career it could only be caused by their common
anxiety for Mr. Carmichael.  As a matter of fact,
when one has seen as little of one's father as had
Ferlie it was not him one missed so much as his
Presence and that which he stood for in a household.
</p>

<p>
There is no law that children and parents should
be one flesh and it was with her mother Ferlie had
corresponded; not with the man whose ideas on
children's upbringing dovetailed with Mary's
thread-bare creed concerning "Her that overcometh the
pudding," with the added clause that should life
not provide sufficient obstacles upon which to test
the will they must be artificially fashioned.
</p>

<p>
In the end Ferlie went to Lady Cardew's dance,
clad in virgin white, reminiscent of her confirmation,
since Mrs. Carmichael's mind was nothing if not
unoriginal and Ferlie did not really care.
</p>

<p>
White was not exactly the fashion for débutantes
that Season, so it was unavoidable that she should
look like a snowdrop which had somehow mistaken
the time of year and arrived among a riot of summer
flowers.
</p>

<p>
So, doubtless, would the young man have put it,
lounging in rather a tired fashion in the vicinity
of the Refreshments (liquid), had he possessed poetical
leanings.  As it was, conscious of the quickening
of a somewhat jaded appetite for débutantes, he
decided that he would dance this evening, after
all.
</p>

<p>
Lady Cardew was greatly relieved by this decision.
Girls were plentiful, men few; and she always
prided herself upon eschewing that modern form of
invitation which requests a girl to bring her
"dancing-partner."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie was more fortunate than many in the
possession of a brother whose good nature could
usually be relied upon, although he did not describe
himself as a dancing-man.  But Peter had not been
able to come to-night.
</p>

<p>
Lord Clifford Greville-Mainwaring, aged twenty-six,
had lately, by an unforeseen railway accident,
succeeded to his uncle's estate.  For a wonder, not
only were these considerable, but the means to
maintain them were adequate.  He was the Catch
of the Season and perfectly aware of that interesting
truth.  Mammas had a furtive eye upon him;
daughters a calculating one, as they weighed his
tall but rather meagre proportions against the
knowledge that Jack here and Eric there, if infinitely
better-looking, were obliged to admit that their
chins were their fortunes.
</p>

<p>
Dancers are born, not made.  Ferlie was a Lucky
One.  Clifford Greville-Mainwaring began to enjoy
her ingenuous enjoyment.  She acknowledged very
recent escape from school but wore a mystifyingly
philosophical air which intrigued him.  He had
been fully prepared to initiate her into the mysteries
of a first flirtation; always excepting, he supposed,
the school music or drawing-master of ascetic or
bulbous personal appearance.
</p>

<p>
But she had proved very unapproachable, even
behind the most sheltering palms in the conservatory
with its cunningly shaded lights.  And he did not
want to frighten her.
</p>

<p>
"There is something about you," he said, "which
reminds one of a tune one has heard and lost and
which one always hopes someone will come along
humming so that one may recapture it for ever."
</p>

<p>
"But there are some tunes," Ferlie replied,
"which, having recaptured, one would give a great
deal to lose again."
</p>

<p>
His was not a very fertile brain and he clung
passionately to his simile, which had struck him as
perfect in its way; so passionately that anyone more
sophisticated than Ferlie might have suspected him,
with perfect justification, of being a little drunk.
But she was growing sleepy and merely thought it
exceedingly civil of him to insist on seeing her
home.
</p>

<p>
His own car replaced the taxi that had brought
her.  She took leave of her hostess impervious to the
launched arrows of half-a-hundred eyes.
</p>

<p>
Had Greville-Mainwaring not given his chauffeur
leave of absence and so found himself obliged to
drive the new Crossley, Ferlie might not have been
so ready to accord him polite permission to call.
So indifferent that permission.  She was really
uncertain of the correct procedure and, in her
preoccupied state, took the easiest course, and then
forgot Mainwaring in finding a letter from Cyprian
awaiting her on the hall table.
</p>

<p>
Not till Lady Cardew put in an ecstatic appearance
on the following Sunday afternoon did
Mrs. Carmichael learn that her daughter had been
considered "the success of the evening."
</p>

<p>
"Quite like an advertisement for Pompeian Scent
or Powder, or whatever it is that is supposed to
attract the elusive male," said Lady Cardew,
warmly sympathetic with Mrs. Carmichael's reverse
of fortune and very much alive to the possibility
of doing her a real good turn.  "My dear!  Only
imagine if something came of it!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carmichael was a little fluttered.  One had
pictured Ferlie being introduced by her father, in
due course, to the eligible officials of Burma.  Though
that dream had faded this was, to put it tritely, so
sudden.  And Ferlie's own silence seemed remarkable.
Lady Cardew misread it.
</p>

<p>
"Girlish dignity, Linda.  She could hardly assume
anything on an evening's acquaintance, even if
these modern young people waste very little time.
And though there are the usual rumours that Clifford
has been a bit wild, you and I, as women of the
world, realize that it is better for a young man to
have That Kind of Thing behind him than before."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
On the strength of this exciting conversation
Greville-Mainwaring received a warmly uncritical
reception when he casually arrived with his
card-case the following week.
</p>

<p>
It must be confessed that, up to half an hour
previously, he had forgotten Ferlie as completely
as the tune so glibly cited on the night of the dance.
He was going to a bridge party in the neighbourhood
and the sudden recognition of her windows reminded
him of a half-finished piece of work.
</p>

<p>
It might be amusing to take her out driving, with
Briggs discreetly officiating at the wheel and the
car half-closed.  At any rate, he might as well see
her again.  Now he came to think of it, that
unembarrassed survey of her fellow-creatures could not
foreshadow Victorian innocence.  And Clifford
prided himself upon knowing the modern dancing
girl for exactly what she was.
</p>

<p>
He was annoyed to find Ferlie "out."  Gropingly,
he fancied that she should have remained at home
during calling hours, until his expected visit.
Evidently, such a course had not occurred to her.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carmichael gave him tea at one end of the
big drawing-room, full of Eastern spoil, and Peter
strolled in for his, late, abstracted and unimpressed.
</p>

<p>
"I've heard that Ferlie is a decent dancer," he
said.
</p>

<p>
And, "We shall always regret that if she, eventually,
has a Season in Simla," said Mrs. Carmichael,
"her father and I will not be there to see her a
social success.  Simla is always full of pretty girls,
but, sometimes, I think that Ferlie has unusual
charm."
</p>

<p>
Mainwaring, thwarted in his desire to see her
again, began to agree.  With Mr. Carmichael at
home Clifford might, possibly, have been weighed
himself in the balance and found wanting.  The
cooler judgment of Ferlie's father would not have
placed the worldly goods, with which this young man
might undertake to endow his daughter, favourably
against the fact that he did not look as if he could
ever have earned even a small portion of them on
his own account, either in the past or future.  The
signs of dissipation on the not ill-looking, but weak,
face must have stung to criticism the Puritan elements
of a mind belonging essentially to the labourer who
has borne the burden and the heat of the day.  As
things were, Peter took a more healthy interest in
the make of the man's car than in his character, and
Mrs. Carmichael saw no further than that here was
a possibility of Ferlie's making up for that "K,"
lost to their branch of the Family.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, Clifford Greville-Mainwaring began,
rather frequently, to be found in the drawing-room
of the house about to be sold over the Family's
heads, and Ferlie, in a few hastily-bought frocks,
frequented Thés Dansant and Private Views under
the complacent eye of Lady Cardew; at which
functions Clifford, invariably hovering, fascinated
by her indifference to his marked attentions, waited
to take her home.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie, too, waited for something these days, but
nobody realized that it was the mail.  Doubtful
whether she realized it herself until that inevitable
event from which, in looking back afterwards, she
dated her "growing up."
</p>

<p>
Champagne-cup, mingled with the strains of
"Wyoming" in a softly-lit private ball-room, made
up Clifford's vacillating mind for him; the touch
of his hands upon her thinly silk-and-chiffon-covered
knees made up Ferlie's for her.  There was
no mistaking the passionate warmth of her refusal.
Till this moment her swift glimpses of "Society,"
overshadowed as they were by anxiety for the future,
had affected her only as part of a drugging dream.
Now she awakened to the direction in which she
was drifting.
</p>

<p>
"But you don't understand," said Clifford, too
amazed for coherent thought, "I meant to ask you
to marry me!"
</p>

<p>
"I know you did," admitted Ferlie gravely;
"no one has ever asked me such a thing before,
but I knew at once what you meant.  And if you
are disappointed I am very sorry that I don't
want to."
</p>

<p>
She had a feeling that the rejection of one's first
marriage proposal should be couched in more
elegant diction, but, really, there seemed nothing
more to say than just that.  Marriage meant living
with a person for always.  She was quite certain
that she did not wish to live with Lord Clifford
Greville-Mainwaring for always.  She enjoyed
dancing with him but, when you came to think of it,
dancing played an extraordinarily small part in
one's existence.  She was puzzled because Clifford
did not seem to understand her point of view at all,
and she wished he would sit further off.  They were
returning home in the Crossley, with Briggs driving.
Later, Peter, descending the turn of the staircase,
overheard Clifford's parting words.
</p>

<p>
"My dear girl, you don't know me yet!  I shall
go on coming until I get a different answer.  That's
the sort of man I am."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie decided it would be hopeless to explain the
sort of woman she was, and wondered how often
she could contrive to be absent when Clifford called
in this optimistic fashion throughout the week.
She was, somehow, inclined to surmise that his
resolution would not survive a week's rebuffs and
she wondered why she had not noticed before that
he used some sort of scent on his hair.  Meanwhile,
</p>

<p>
"That chap and Ferlie," said Peter, having faded
away unnoticed to his mother's sitting-room, "are
brazenly approaching matrimony to-night under
the umbrella-stand.  From what I could gather
Ferlie seems to consider it an over-rated institution."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carmichael's embroidery dropped on her lap.
</p>

<p>
"You do not mean to say she is refusing him,
Peter?  When Lady Cardew and I have worked
so hard."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, have you?" asked Peter.  "Why?"
</p>

<p>
"It is a mystery to me," said his mother, "how
short-sighted men can be.  Do you happen to know
his income?"
</p>

<p>
"I happen to have noticed his shoes," Peter
retorted: "they are the genuine co-respondent
article, and no mistake."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you mean."
</p>

<p>
"Do you like the chap, Mother?"
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong with him?  There is nothing to
dislike so far as I can see."
</p>

<p>
"That's just it," Peter admitted.  "There is
nothing to like or dislike&mdash;except his shoes."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carmichael decided that Peter was just
being tiresome.
</p>

<p>
"It might mean a great deal to you if Ferlie
accepted him," she declared.  "He would be sure
to make a settlement upon her&mdash;and if you could
even borrow money, Peter, just now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Peter started slightly and began to whistle out of
tune.  Still whistling, he strolled to the door.  On
the threshold he broke off to say: "Well, of course,
it's none of my business.  To me there seems
nothing to take hold of in the man, one way or
another."  A little pause, and then, "But it's
Ferlie's pigeon, after all."
</p>

<p>
They waited for Ferlie to announce her dubious
tidings, but, to her mother's surprise, Ferlie said
nothing.
</p>

<p>
This was making Mainwaring too exclusively her
pigeon.  Mrs. Carmichael tackled her at the
hair-dressing hour when the lights were low.  Extracted
confession.
</p>

<p>
"But, my darling, do you realize...?"  So
obviously, Ferlie didn't.
</p>

<p>
She stood behind her mother and her eyes sought
the shadows of tapping branches on the window with
a wistful strained expression.  The mail that week
was late....
</p>

<p>
Yes, she had resolved three years earlier that she
did not want to marry.  <i>He</i> had suggested that type
of husband which men in her father's position were
usually able to provide for their daughters and she
had scorned the nebulous suitor.  Did He remember?
</p>

<p>
It was a long time since she had heard of Muriel
Vane.  After her return from abroad Muriel had
gravitated to a different "Set."  There were Rumours.
Lady Cardew palpably refrained from quoting them
in the presence of the Spotless Young of the Right
Set.  If Muriel had attracted Cyprian what would
he have thought of Phyllis?
</p>

<p>
Peter looked quite stern at any mention of
that quite ordinary Christian name now.  Ferlie
wondered if it were principle or whether he still
considered himself irrevocably yoked to Phyllis's
memory...
</p>

<p>
What was her mother saying about Peter?  Mrs. Carmichael's
plaintive tones duetted with the singing
of the kettle laying the foundations for her nightly
cup of cocoa.
</p>

<p>
"And, of course, you must do just as you think
best....  Poor Peter!  Your father's convalescence
is being so retarded with worry.  Though, I'm sure,
at my time of life it isn't very easy to begin to do
without things.  You, fresh from school, young and
strong, will probably not miss luxuries....  And
... your happiness is all that matters, darling.
I wouldn't for the world persuade you against
your inclination....  Your father always says I've
been too weak with my children....  I wonder
whether Peter will ever get over it?  Lady Cardew
thought Lord Clifford Greville-Mainwaring such a
desirable young man.  Your father and I would
have been so much relieved&mdash;for that Simla Season
may never come off.  I was relying on the Durrants,
but Gwen Durrant will soon be leaving school
herself.  There was the question of your
passage-money too.  Do you know there are more than a
million superfluous women in England...?
</p>

<p>
"... Well, good night, darling.  Yes, I'm
disappointed, but you mustn't think of Us; only
of Yourself.  No, thank you.  I don't think I feel
like cocoa to-night, after all..."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Two days later, a Ferlie with brooding lips, who
had twice circumvented Clifford's indications that
he came of the Bull-dog Breed, sought Peter where
he was engaged in discarding superfluous treasures
for which there would be neither nor lot in the
life to come.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sorry, too, about this marriage, Peter?"
</p>

<p>
He avoided her direct gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Girls do marry," he said, rather banally.
</p>

<p>
"I know they do.  But there's such a thing
as&mdash;being in love."
</p>

<p>
Peter sat back on his haunches, busily dissecting
the corpse of a camera.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder!" cryptically.  Said Ferlie, "You
always thought queerly about these things."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I still think queerly about them.
That is, if common sense is queer....  Phyllis
professed to be in love with me.  Of course you are
naturally more religious.  I suppose you inherit
it from Mother.  I do not mean that you are an
orthodox Churchwoman&mdash;save the mark!  But your
sentiments are religious, Ferlie.  Love, the
Sacrament! ... and so on.  <i>I</i> know that Love is a
joke invented by Nature to enable her to work out
her own ends.  If you ask me what I think of Mainwaring
I say he just can't be thought about.  Whatever
he's heading to be he has not got there yet.  You
could make pretty much what you liked of him.
Also, you probably wouldn't see very much of
him after that first honeymoon farce was played
through.  And then you could live your own life;
one which might be made as interesting and as full
as you pleased.  And, you see, it isn't as if there
were Anyone Else on the mat."
</p>

<p>
So that was what Peter thought about it.  And
now Ferlie knew.
</p>

<p>
In the light of which knowledge she opened a
certain despatch-case and re-read the letters she had
received from Cyprian since writing to inform him
that she had left school.
</p>

<p>
The mining life seemed lonely enough and a
thread of tiredness stole in and out of the
neatly-formed syllables.  Ferlie, with faint misgivings,
asked herself whether Cyprian were not one of
those men who might be described in a book as
having made a mess of his life.  Instinctive wisdom
whispered that Muriel would have made a greater
mess of it for him had she given herself the
opportunity; but it was doubtful that Cyprian, even now,
believed that.  No credit to him to be so faithful
to his ideals; it was just the way he was made.
</p>

<p>
"And if I had an Ideal," Ferlie told herself,
"I could be faithful to it too."
</p>

<p>
At tea her mother asked her if she had a cold....
</p>

<p>
Articles of furniture were already beginning to
disappear from the house; two valuable pictures had
gone to Christie's.  Ferlie suggested: "Margery
wants me to go back for a few days.  If you
don't mind, Mother, I should like to go."
</p>

<p>
"Only till Monday, then," said her mother, rather
miserably; "Next week the packing begins in
earnest."
</p>

<p>
They were chivalrous to Ferlie in their studious
avoidance of Clifford Greville-Mainwaring's name.
</p>

<p>
At the back of her brain flitted the ghost of a
memory: the Zoological Gardens and a lion's cage.
Somebody had told her that the bars of those other
cages, the existence of which she had guessed at,
were made of gold.  Was Mainwaring unconsciously
forging them now for her?  She decided to discuss
the matter with Margery.  There was no nonsense
about Margery.  Her practical scrutiny of the
situation might lay the spectres of those unborn
dreams filming Ferlie's vision.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
And Margery, once approached, certainly made
things sound simpler.
</p>

<p>
"You have no reasonable objection to the man?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't like his touching me."
</p>

<p>
"Do you like the thought of anyone's touching
you?  Not experimented yet?"
</p>

<p>
Ferlie shook her head, her face bent low over the
glove-satchet she was sorting.
</p>

<p>
"Yet everyone, even in our effete, old-fashioned
Guard of Die-Hards, has to tackle Sex in the long
run," Margery reminded her.  "Otherwise, how
would the world go on?  The Modern Aristocracy,
<i>alias</i> The Smart Set which gets put on the stage,
believes in facing more facts than usually exist.
But it <i>is</i> a truth that, in marriage, familiarity breeds
indifference to many matters one would have shied
at the very mention of before."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?" questioned Ferlie resentfully.
</p>

<p>
"I have watched my girl-friends marry and
invited their confidences afterwards," said Margery
with a retrospective smile.  "Life is a muddle of
rough and smooth for them all, whether they went
into it with wilfully closed eyes or curiously
wide-open ones.  I'll tell you someone else who always
seemed to me to be looking for sacramental happiness
and getting terribly hurt when he found what
he thought was trouble, just like you.  The man
who ought to have been your uncle and wasn't.
I gather some folks have extra sensitive feet on the
world's highway, and a too unshaken belief in the
everlasting beauty of the hedge-flowers.  By the
way, do you know about that Vane woman he was
so keen on when you were a kid at school?"
</p>

<p>
"Only that she turned out&mdash;not very nice."
</p>

<p>
Margery laughed queerly but did not pursue
the subject.
</p>

<p>
"It's a mercy," she said, "that your Cyprian-man
will have cut his wisdom-teeth by the time he sees
her again.  Do you ever hear from him now?"
</p>

<p>
"N-not lately."
</p>

<p>
"Well, his avuncular advice would probably
coincide with mine if he were here.  All men are
like peas, and most women, when it comes to the
Year-after-the-Wedding.  Even Tristran and Iseult
would have pretty surely grown fat at forty when
the children were growing poetical.  At forty everyone
grows either fat or thin and begins to mistrust
moonlight for reading the Book of Life by.  In Cliff
Mainwaring&mdash;I used to know him in his college
days&mdash;you will have a husband who will never set
the Thames alight, nor need to.  And you'll live
very peaceable in consequence.  I shall expect to
be asked to stay with you."
</p>

<p>
And that was what Margery thought about it.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<p>
"I have <i>surprising</i> news for you," wrote
Mrs. Carmichael, "Cyprian is at Home!  His Company
has sent him to attend some <i>Conference</i> in connection
with the <i>mines</i>.  I have not seen him myself.  He
called when I was out and of course <i>Peter</i> is away
at Wimbledon seeing your father's cousin about that
clerkship.  Cyprian left a note to say he had been
<i>lent</i> a flat by a friend.  One of those self-contained
affairs in Jermyn Street.  <i>Service-flats</i>, I think they
are called, with the kind of lift which always terrifies
me that you are supposed to work yourself by pressing
buttons and <i>not</i> a hall-porter.  I should not <i>dream</i>
of going there unless Peter were with me and, as
likely as not, poor Peter would forget <i>which</i> buttons
these days, himself, and shoot us into the <i>wrong</i>
flat when it would be <i>most</i> awkward to explain.
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian said he should be in all <i>Sunday</i> if any
of us cared to ring him up.  You had better write
and tell him that I shall be at Richmond this
weekend myself, seeing your father in the <i>Home</i>.  I
suppose you will be returning on Monday and can arrange
to meet him then and relate our <i>distressing news</i>."
</p>

<p>
For a wonder, Mrs. Carmichael did not forget
to add Cyprian's full address.  Followed the plaintive
reminder that Lord Clifford had asked to be allowed
to take Ferlie to a matinée on Monday; that the
poor fellow was looking very pulled down and she
was quite certain that if Ferlie put off Cyprian till
Tuesday he would quite understand.  P.S.&mdash;"My
new georgette was <i>ruined</i> by that <i>horrid</i> little dog
of the Glennies' which cost <i>a hundred guineas</i>.
I would not pay that to have my carpet and my
friends' dresses spoilt, and I don't believe it, though
Lady Cardew tells me it is a <i>fact</i>, but she is never
very lucid in these matters."
</p>

<p>
The strong point of this letter, also, being anything
but its lucidity, Ferlie did not waste time considering
which of the canine commandments framed for
drawing-rooms had been violated at her mother's
expense.  Three words, only, hammered at her
brain: "Cyprian is Home."
</p>

<p>
(1) That explained his silence of the past weeks.
</p>

<p>
(2) He would be in all Sunday.
</p>

<p>
(3) She must see him before Monday's matinée.
</p>

<p>
Her way instantaneously seemed to grow clear
and hard, like a path on ice.  Perhaps Cyprian had
escaped the rules of captivity away there among
his lonely scattered mines.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian, who had come to her rescue in nursery-days
when Hell loomed before her in the glowing
grate, near the yawning tomb of the toy-cupboard
and when the night-light, which should have
illumined the tired pilgrim's path to a Heaven of
sunny dreams, had blown out....  "And
... you will always like me best, Cyprian?"
... "Of course ...  Of course."
</p>

<p>
If anyone could now prevent the barred gates
from closing upon her, it must be Cyprian.  If he
failed she would go to the matinée, thought Ferlie.
It would not matter where she went, if Cyprian
failed.
</p>

<p>
"But," protested Margery, later, "I thought
you were motoring up with Dad on Monday?  The
only possible train from here on Sunday does not
reach town till just before dinner."
</p>

<p>
"It will do quite well," said Ferlie.  "And I
really must go."
</p>

<p>
At the station Margery launched her parting
shaft.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye ... My Lady! ... Remember, you
can be happy, plus money, with many a person whom
you could not live beside for an hour in a little
cottage with roses round the door."
</p>

<p>
And she slammed down the window of the compartment
for the traveller's last gestures of farewell.
</p>

<p>
So motionless sat Ferlie during the next two hours
that an artist, thus minded, could have made a
detailed portrait of her before the train sighed
gustily up Victoria platform.
</p>

<p>
Rain, in the evening air, and black and gold
puddles reflecting the passing figures.
</p>

<p>
She made her way along to the cloak-room and
deposited the box which did duty for a week-end
of light dresses, but her suit-case went with her
into the taxi.  The man received indifferently her
stammering request to be taken to the Jermyn Street
address.
</p>

<p>
Inside the taxi it was hot and steamy.  The last
occupant had mingled scent and cigarettes.  Ferlie
dropped both windows and allowed the rush of
cool damp air from the flickering streets to whirl
her hair about her face.  She passed a chamois
leather over her eyelids and nose, and shrugged
impatiently at the reflection the narrow strip of
glass gave back to her under a withered spray of
lilies-of-the-valley.
</p>

<p>
She paid the taxi and waited to watch the man
drive away, before turning into the bare stone
hallway to read the minute directions on the lift.
Although a more adventurous spirit than her mother
she decided to walk up.  Her watch told her that
it was a quarter to eight.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Cyprian had spent most of the time, since a late
cup of tea, in writing.  He was very busy.  This
could not be counted as coming home on Leave
and he did not expect to have more than six short
weeks in England.
</p>

<p>
Whimsically, he wondered, as the twilight deepened
what it was all about&mdash;this busy-ness with regard
to somebody else's affairs.  Since he had chosen to
turn his back upon a sheltered and unruffled peace
(or would it have been stultification?) and taken
the sea-ways towards more glowing suns than ever
dawned upon the University towns of England,
what Grail had he been pursuing?  He had earned
his bread and a little butter.  For the rest there had
remained the distant echoes of a siren's singing,
now without power to lure him closer, and Ferlie's
gradually maturing letters.
</p>

<p>
Had he wanted Ferlie to grow up?  She had shown
precocious signs of it during his last Leave.  If he
had lost his little companion of the Zoological
Gardens England must now become as lonely as
Burma.  There was the influence of that strange
woman who had had tea with them: the aunt.
Her name had made him think of hair-oil.  Cyprian
laid down his pen.  In the brightness of the
firelight he had not noticed his omission to turn up the
electric reading-lamp; and the East ages the eyes.
He ought to feel younger than he did.  One had to
take malaria into account.  How old was Ferlie
now?  Nearly eighteen?  Still a child to thirty-nine....
</p>

<p>
No one had rung him up.  He particularly refrained
from asking Ferlie to do so in his note, in case she
too should be very busy these days.  There would
be gaieties in town for the Carmichaels' daughter
at eighteen, and hordes of young men who did
complicated things with their feet in ball-rooms.
Young men, so much younger than Cyprian, that
they could not have shared his short career as a
soldier, early invalided out in the first push.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes now, when he coughed, he wondered
whether the surgeon had succeeded in extracting
quite all the bits of shrapnel.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie, in those days, had not even attained the
dignity of flapperdom.  Too small for khaki-worship.
And it was during those years, he had heard, that
Muriel began to lose her silver-fair head.  He
remembered his one last futile attempt to win her
before returning to Burma.  His hand, the forefinger
stained with ink, stretched irresolutely towards
the telephone.  As if in direct answer to the impulse
a bell rang.  The electric bell of his flat.  Curious.
The valet of his rooms used a latch-key, discreetly,
when the flat's occupant was out, and had already
taken his dinner order.  The hand-lift would do the
remaining work of the evening in bringing up the
meal and taking it down.
</p>

<p>
He crossed the room and switched on the crimson-shaded
lamp in the lobby.  The dim silhouette of a
feminine figure was outlined on the frosted glass of
the staircase door.  He slipped back the catch.
</p>

<p>
She stood in the frame of the dark fluted doorway.
</p>

<p>
White fox furs at her throat, fresh violets nestling
in them from some country hot-house; above, the
hair of a Beata Beatrix escaped from under her
soft grey suede travelling hat.
</p>

<p>
So this was Ferlie.  Ferlie, whose letters had grown
mature.
</p>

<p>
"How long do we have to stand here and look
at one another, Cyprian?"
</p>

<p>
The tremulous laughter of her greeting broke
the spell.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian, blinking in the red lamp-light, was
beginning to believe her an apparition.  He stood
aside to let her pass and slipped back the travelling
wrap from her shoulders with hands which were not
quite steady.
</p>

<p>
"I did not think you would be coming so late
as this," he said.  "You never rang up, Ferlie."
</p>

<p>
"No." ... She curled into a chair beside the
narrow fireplace and held out chilled fingers to the
blaze.
</p>

<p>
"I have been in the country all this week.  I only
came up this afternoon; the first train after I got
Mother's letter.  You wrote to Mother; not to me."
</p>

<p>
He ignored that.
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear&mdash;where are you dining?"
</p>

<p>
("Men," thought Ferlie.  "Oh, Men!")  She
repudiated the thought of food with a gesture.
</p>

<p>
"Turn up the light, Cyprian.  I want to look
at you."
</p>

<p>
He obeyed and, kneeling, stirred the fire.  She
noticed the hair upon his temples, iron-grey; the
little tired lines about his eyes and mouth; the
quick nervousness of the sensitive hands.  The East
had taken its toll of the scholarly dreamer who had
allowed his life to drift out on the tide rather than
remain upon smooth shores to face a woman's "No."
</p>

<p>
With lightning rapidity the impression was
registered on her heart that Cyprian wanted taking
care of.  She was not absolutely right.  He was a
giver himself.  He wanted someone to take care of.
Another flash, this time searching out the exact
truth: Cyprian was not used to women.
</p>

<p>
"There has been no one since Muriel," decided
Ferlie; and feared that name no more.
</p>

<p>
A gust of wind through the open door fluttered
to her feet a sheet of close fine writing, the Greek
e's betraying his classics and every letter standing
out in equal value.  It was the report on which
he had been engaged that afternoon.  She stooped
and handed it back to him.
</p>

<p>
"I have interrupted you, Cyprian."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you have.  What else have I ever
existed for but to keep my temper under your
interruptions, Ferlie?"
</p>

<p>
"There is so much to say," and she drank him in
with happy eyes.
</p>

<p>
He ran one thumb along the edge of the paper,
still faintly worried.
</p>

<p>
"But I must arrange something.  You can't go
without any dinner at all.  I've ordered 'for one'
up here and, of course, you must eat mine.  I'll
see if it's what you like."
</p>

<p>
There was a hint of exasperation in her voice
as she checked his advance upon the bell.
</p>

<p>
"Do they allow you such small helpings?  I can
share your dinner when they send it up, if you will
insist upon making me eat when I don't want to."
</p>

<p>
She pulled him down beside her, by his sleeve,
into the other chair.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know you have not even said that you
are glad to see me?"
</p>

<p>
"Glad?  Why, Ferlie, you know&mdash;&mdash;" he broke
off to stare back at her, and then repeated,
"Glad?"
</p>

<p>
"You have not changed," said Ferlie slowly,
"I suppose I have?"
</p>

<p>
This was frank coquetry and she felt a little
ashamed when, with unsuspecting disregard of the
fact, he said,
</p>

<p>
"Stand up again.  I haven't made any of the
correct remarks.  Why, your skirts are as short as
they were before!"
</p>

<p>
"Shorter, Silly!  Fashion now decrees that one
must put up one's skirts and let down one's hair on
leaving school."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad they have left your hair alone."
</p>

<p>
"There was not much sense in trying to 'put up'
a head, bobbed by Nature, when Art was busy
bobbing all Nature's long locks.  This bush will
never grow beyond my shoulders, if I live to be
eighty.  I inherit it from Aunt B.  That was why she
shingled, you know."
</p>

<p>
His scrutiny came to rest on the widely set grey
irises, circled by their dark golden fringe.
</p>

<p>
"No.  You have not grown up," he decided.
"You will probably eat all the ice-cream to-night
and leave me the cutlets.  We were always Jack
Spratt and his wife."
</p>

<p>
She nodded gravely and he added, "Also, you
will not want your wine dry."
</p>

<p>
"I am ignorant enough to have imagined,
hitherto, that all wine must, of necessity, be wet.
However, water out of your wash-stand carafe
will do for me.  I expect your tooth-glass is luxuriously
patterned to be in keeping with the rest of things
here."
</p>

<p>
They chattered inconsequently till the lift arrived
with its first burden of dishes, and not until the
dessert had returned to the depths whence it had
mysteriously emerged and after they had made
themselves as ridiculous as two picnicking children,
did Ferlie get down to the Family news.
</p>

<p>
She touched very lightly upon her "dancing
partner," Clifford Greville-Mainwaring, but the
deepened tinge of her face did not escape Cyprian
because, by then, he was finding it difficult not to
look at her all the time.
</p>

<p>
"I am incredibly sorry about your father," he
said, shying away from an uncomfortable idea.
"You all strike me as being wonderfully plucky."
</p>

<p>
"It's worst for Peter," said Ferlie.  And sat silent
for a while considering the problem of Peter.
</p>

<p>
Quite by chance, Cyprian glanced at the clock
and remarked in startled tones that it was past
eleven.
</p>

<p>
"Is it?" she asked indifferently.
</p>

<p>
Her arms were clasped round her knees and her
chin resting on them.  Sometimes she rocked herself
gently backwards and forwards.  He smiled to
himself, remembering the pose since she was seven.
</p>

<p>
"I am thinking it is about time I saw you home,"
he said.  "Mrs. Carmichael will be wondering what
on earth we are doing."
</p>

<p>
"No she will not.  There is no one at home,
Cyprian, and I am not expected back till to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"But where have you arranged to spend the night?"
</p>

<p>
She gave that little shrug of the shoulders, once
characteristic of fourteen-year-old Ferlie shrugging
the Inessential off her horizon.
</p>

<p>
"Here, I think," she said with wide eyes on the
ruby coals.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian laughed.  Then he protested, in his
amusement, at the simplicity of Ferlie grown-up.
Presently, he sobered and began to attempt explanations;
to all of which she turned a dispassionately
deaf ear.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, dear," said Cyprian at last.
</p>

<p>
"Where to?"
</p>

<p>
Driving it home that this unexpected arrival on
his doorstep had, in very sooth, been a Ferlie-esque
escapade from which he must extricate her; if
she would lend herself to extrication.  He was
honestly puzzled.
</p>

<p>
Of course, he realized that, since they were
Themselves, and not another couple, her outlook
was perfectly reasonable.  Ferlie and he.  A law
unto themselves long ago, when she awoke at night
to scream because her surroundings were dark and
lonely.  A law unto themselves when he received her
at the hands of Martha and Mary, mistrusters of men
in general, but willing to admit him into the fold
on account of that farcical avuncular status.  A law
unto themselves in their unnaturally unusual
correspondence with its sprawled confidences on one side
and its restrained admissions on the other of his
need of her in the background of his life.
</p>

<p>
That need was within him still, but it must be his
part to limit it now that she was grown up: to take
over the reins of friendship and&mdash;and normalize it.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Cyprian," said Ferlie, quietly watching
him, "are you, even now, an occupant of a cage in
the greater Zoological Garden, outside the walls of
which I promised you, a long while ago, that I
always intended to remain?"
</p>

<p>
This was utter nonsense.  Ferlie, with her talk
of cages at fourteen, was not to be encouraged, but
Ferlie, holding similar views at eighteen, was, most
distinctly, to be brought up short.
</p>

<p>
He shifted the chair impatiently and she forestalled
his reply.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," she said, "that some buy their
freedom in the course of years with the big price
of experience, but others are born free.  If you have
not bought yours yet you will some day.  But I was
born free.  Peter, too, I think.  He has the courage
of his beliefs; he is no captive to past customs,
nor is the fear of the neighbour the beginning of his
wisdom.  If we walk into cages it will be of our own
free will, and not because any stale bait can tempt
us from within, nor any pursuing hounds scare us
from without."
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie," said the bewildered man beside her,
"will you please tell me exactly what you mean?"
</p>

<p>
She shook a tangled lock out of her eyes and, at
that moment, in the gilding firelight, he had an odd
fancy that a man might fill his hands with sovereigns
who had the courage to plunge them into her hair.
Involuntarily, he touched the ruffled rebellious head.
</p>

<p>
"You and I have always understood one another,"
he reminded her.
</p>

<p>
She imprisoned his fingers between her two soft
palms.
</p>

<p>
"It is a good many years now, Cyprian, since
you and I became friends.  Whenever I have had
need of you and you could possibly reach me, you
have always come.  We have had to face separation
for what has seemed a vitally long time to me since
your last leave.  To you, already mentally settled
and developed, it may not have seemed so long.
But I have been half afraid that your return would
separate us more surely than, so far, has the sea.
To test that fear, I came to-night, because I have
need of you, Cyprian.  To-night, not to-morrow.
When I was little, what help could you have given
me by waiting for the daylight?  I used to think
you could save me from the tomb which was all
ready to close on me.  Now it is a cage of which
I am afraid.  I want to stay with you until that
fear is past.  I want to assure myself of you; to
re-learn you in the light of my increased knowledge
of life.  To-night, not to-morrow.  For to-morrow
I have to make a decision concerning that cage,
and the decision depends upon what I may learn
of you in the little time we have together to-night.
I knew how you would shrink from offending
Convention; therefore I have frustrated Convention.
We have only a few more free hours in which to
pick up the threads which may have got dropped
and twisted.  Upon the untangling of them rests
my decision of to-morrow.  I have gone to sleep in
your arms so often that it is a very natural thing
for me to remain beside you now until we can both
sleep&mdash;at rest, in one another's presence again.
I need you, Cyprian, just now.  And I want you to
realize just how much, or how little, you need
me."
</p>

<p>
All but mesmerized, he listened.  That which
was hide-bound in him, and entirely reticent British,
put up a dull fight against the naked simplicity of
her words.  He said weakly: "Dear, you are so
young.  You do not understand."
</p>

<p>
"I understand 'What a Young Girl Ought to
Know,'" and she bubbled over with quick mockery.
"Curiously enough, the knowledge neither distresses
nor shames me.  This isn't the Victorian era.  But
all that I understand, or misunderstand, about the
threadbare 'Facts of Life,' affects neither of us
with regard to this situation.  We have cherished our
hours in the past, scattered here and there, each like
a desert oasis.  We have come to another now.
Later, very much later, I think I shall probably fall
asleep in this chair and then you may cover me up
and depart in peace, yourself, to bed.  And to-morrow
we can breakfast somewhere together as if I had just
come upon the morning train and you had met me,
and no one need hear that we spent a happy night,
or thereabouts, re-discovering one another."
</p>

<p>
Stirred to the depths and vexed with himself for
his susceptibility to her moods, Cyprian withdrew
his hand into safety.
</p>

<p>
"You always had a way of making the unnatural
seem perfectly natural and ordinary."
</p>

<p>
"What forms your opinion on what is 'natural'?"
asked Ferlle, abruptly.
</p>

<p>
His brain groped around in the dark awhile before
he found an answer.
</p>

<p>
"There is a daimon in every man," he insisted
in low tones, speaking more to himself than to her,
"which forces upon him the knowledge when a
thing is not Right, even though it may be Natural."
</p>

<p>
And then, that very daimon, thus invoked, spoke
to him in the ensuing silence.
</p>

<p>
The same child who had fallen asleep on his
shoulder in the past was beside him now, expectant
of the same "crystallized apricot" of comfort.
Let him take heed that it was such comfort as
healed and did not merely drug.  What, for all her
dreams, could she have grasped of the Powers which
spin the dice for good or evil?  Eighteen to thirty-nine!
Supposing he yielded to this childish defiance
of the Unwritten Law and anyone came to know?
He got up and crossing to the window, flung it
wide.  The roar of London traffic rushed upwards
on the rising wind.  He stood, his profile directed
at the struggling smoke-befogged stars; his shoulders,
so moulded to desk-work, a little bowed.  Far below
him, the haunches of a large black draught-horse
lumbered towards a mews.  Its heavy deliberation
touched a chord of memory: a fragment of verse&mdash;Yeats,
wasn't it?&mdash;assailed him in warning.
</p>

<p>
"The years like great black oxen plough the
land, While God the Ploughman gathers in"
... Gathers in ... Gathers in ... The grain?
</p>

<p>
There had been a clever fantastical novel he
believed written round the theme, and he had seen
it filmed.
</p>

<p>
Someone in it had found the long-desired elixir
of Youth.
</p>

<p>
At the time this had not seemed impossible, but
now ... "While God, the Ploughman..."  Anyway,
He did not hold back the great black oxen.
The inexorable ploughing, sowing and garnering
must go on.  Eighteen to thirty-nine.  How possible
to take advantage of Ferlie's crystal faith and
unanalysed affection?  If her words veiled the faint
suggestion that her need of him was as great as his
need of her&mdash;wonderingly, reverently, he repeated
it to himself, "his need of her"&mdash;he must pretend,
for the present at any rate, that he did not hear it.
He must be just to her Youth, that glorious jewel
of Life which she wore with such careless indifference.
</p>

<p>
"The years like great black oxen tread the
world, And God the Herdsman goads them on
behind."
</p>

<p>
That was it....
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian."  Her voice brought him down from
the clouds and he closed the window with a slight
sense of chill.  "Cyprian, look at me."
</p>

<p>
He raised his eyes to hers, to drop them again
immediately.
</p>

<p>
"Can you tell me, honestly," she asked him,
"that you consider it would be what is called a
'sin' for me to lean upon our friendship in the
way I choose, to-night?"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head at that but he would not
answer.
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian, look at me."  Nor would he do that
again.  His eyelids blinked&mdash;their old short-sighted
trick&mdash;over her head, at the sapphire resting against
her white throat, at the dying embers, at the hearth-rug
where lay, kicked free by its owner, a glass-buckled
Cinderella shoe.
</p>

<p>
And she knew that she would be proved helpless
against his refusal so much as to look at his
conception of the Forbidden Thing: for every flutter
of his eyelids was the drawing of a shutter which
blocked from her another window of his soul.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"And now," said Cyprian at last, his voice dry
with exhaustion, "Would you mind going?"
</p>

<p>
Instantaneously, Ferlie turned her back and
thrust her foot into the errant shoe.  In the
doorway she faced him, her cloak over her arm.
</p>

<p>
"You have never asked that of me before," she
said, "and you will never be required to say it
again."
</p>

<p>
Half paralysed he heard the front door bang.
In another moment the wave of reaction set in.
What in thunder was he thinking of to allow her
to go out into Jermyn Street at this hour of the
night, alone?
</p>

<p>
He snatched his hat and followed, gaining on
her by the fact that he could take the lift.  She was
passing under the stone arch leading to the pavement
as he crashed back the gates.
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie!" he called after her, "Wait."  But she
did not stop nor turn her head at the sound of his
footsteps hurrying along behind her.  A taxi crawled
near with its flag up.  He was just too late to prevent
her getting into it.  With feverish presence of mind
he noted the number.  Fortune favoured him, for
it was caught in a block of cars returning from the
theatres, as another car ejected its passenger on the
other side of the road.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian, too fiercely anxious at the moment to
see the humour of the situation, gave his
penny-novelette directions.  The driver awarded him an
indifferent glance and held out his hand for earnest
money.  He was used to minding his own business
in his profession.
</p>

<p>
Once in full pursuit of Ferlie's taxi Cyprian
found himself on the verge of unnatural mirth.  His
third night in England; and he and Ferlie playing
hide-and-seek, in and out of the London traffic,
like any hardened human satyr and some nymph
of the by-streets.  And why?  What was this intangible,
invisible Thing which had suddenly interposed
itself between them?  A silly whim on her part, an
instinct-driven refusal on his and the shadow had
assumed these gigantic proportions.
</p>

<p>
Outside the Carmichaels' town residence, with its
Sale-advertising boards and closed blinds, Ferlie
alighted.
</p>

<p>
From the prompt departure of her driver one
might divulge that she paid him without examining
the fare.  On her own front door-step, wrestling
with her latch-key, Cyprian reached her.
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie, don't be a little goose!"
</p>

<p>
Her eyes meeting his in the reflection of the
street lamp were as hard as pebbles.
</p>

<p>
"Only Beckett is here," she said, referring to the
old butler, "and he has put up the chain.  Since
you must let me in for a silly betrayal of my
unexpected return you had better come down into the
basement and see if you can hoist me through his
bedroom window, if he sleeps with it open.  His
room is next to the pantry and silver-chest.  If I
set an alarm going accidentally, he will only think
it is a burglar at last and plunge his head further
under the clothes."
</p>

<p>
"But, Ferlie&mdash;&mdash;"  She was half-way down the
area steps and he, less familiar with the house,
followed stumblingly.
</p>

<p>
Beckett's window was open and quite near it
stood a rain-barrel.  She tossed the cloak she had
not troubled to put on into Cyprian's arms.
</p>

<p>
"I can't take that with me," she said, and, before
he could recover his breath to protest, she had
reached the summit of the barrel.  An instant she
swayed on the edge of it, balancing herself by means
of a pipe running down from the bathroom window.
She was now only a shadowy shape poised above
him in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Somewhere," the coldly-spoken sentence stole
down to him after she drew herself up on to Beckett's
window-ledge, "I have heard it said that 'to the
pure all things are impure.'"
</p>

<p>
The blank black square of her egress stared
unfathomably back at Cyprian, standing below it with
the loose unfolded cloak, emptied of its owner, in
his arms.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p>
Her father said, "Well, if he is a decent chap, and
Ferlie likes him, she is lucky."  Adding, a little
later, from his pillows, his brow considerably
smoother than it had been for some time past, "At
any rate, he will never leave his wife a pauper."
</p>

<p>
Her mother said, "Oh, my darling!  I <i>always</i>
knew you'd come to see." ... And aye had let
the tears down fall in thanksgiving that there
existed no Jock o' Hazeldean to abstract the bride
at the last moment.
</p>

<p>
Peter said, "There will be lots of girls ready to
scratch your eyes out with envy, Old Thing."
</p>

<p>
Lady Cardew said, "My dear, I thought from the
very first that it was Meant."
</p>

<p>
While, to Ferlie, Clifford said, "I was perfectly
sure you would come round in the end.  I know
women!"
</p>

<p>
And Beckett lost his bet with the cook; perhaps
because he was less inclined to put his head under the
clothes at night than one might think.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian said nothing at all.  He was, apparently,
most tremendously busy; though, as Mrs. Carmichael
justly remarked, "One would have imagined
he would make an effort to come in, considering how
interested he had always been in dear Ferlie as a
child."
</p>

<p>
Dear Ferlie as a woman was beginning to show
herself a little disconcerting.  A dignified demeanour
was all very well for one so soon to wear the title
of Lady Clifford Greville-Mainwaring, but this
complete aloofness to the arrival of satin-lined boxes
and sealed wooden cases was almost irritating.
People were constantly coming up to the scratch, too,
and relations who, in the event of the prospective
bridegroom's comparative penury, would have
considered pepper-pots quite suitable for the state of
life unto which it had pleased God to call Ferlie,
were, in present circumstances, producing eight-day
clocks and jewellery.
</p>

<p>
Dear Clifford, also, was singularly blessed in a
dearth of relatives who would, otherwise, have been
entitled to run appraising eyes over the girl destined
to assist him bear the burden of an ancient name.
</p>

<p>
"Not but that," as Ferlie's mother more than
once pointed out to congratulating friends, "the
Carmichaels could hold their heads as high as the
Greville-Mainwarings in <i>that</i> respect."  She trusted
Lady Cardew had rubbed it into the Duchess.  The
Duchess herself, a first cousin of Clifford's father,
emerged presently, from the mist of introductions,
as an untidy, acidly cheerful old lady, much more
interested in horse-racing than in Clifford; though
she had been overheard to express a hope that his
fiancée had not bitten off more than she could chew.
Which vulgarity reconvinced Ferlie's mother that
everybody in the Peerage had not got in, so to speak,
by the front door.
</p>

<p>
The Carmichaels were unmistakably "front door"
people, even though Ferlie's particular branch
might remain collateral for some years to come in
default of railway accidents and infantile epidemics.
</p>

<p>
There was no earthly reason to delay the wedding.
The doctors had not made up their minds as to the
date of Mr. Carmichael's operation and the sooner
his wife was free to devote all her energies to this
decision the better.
</p>

<p>
Lady Cardew advised haste on account of her own
private recollection that Clifford had, more than once,
been guilty of changing a matrimonially-inclined
mind.  Had she imparted this news to Ferlie the
latter might have insisted on delay; at least until
Cyprian should be completely out of her range,
in Burma.  As it was, he received a silver-edged
invitation to the wedding with everybody else;
though Mrs. Carmichael hoped to give him to understand
quite clearly that he had fallen from grace,
when they met face to face on the Day.
</p>

<p>
He had decided&mdash;nearly&mdash;to refuse it.
</p>

<p>
He had decided&mdash;nearly&mdash;that Ferlie could never
have meant anything at all by that most particularly
Ferlie-esque mood.
</p>

<p>
He had decided&mdash;nearly&mdash;that he had done Right.
</p>

<p>
But the Daimon produced nothing to demonstrate
that virtue brings its own reward.
</p>

<p>
He had made two attempts to see Ferlie and arrive
at some sort of an explanation, but on each occasion
she had deliberately frustrated him.
</p>

<p>
He had found it impossible to make his letter of
congratulation anything but stereotyped.  Cyprian
was not good at expressing himself except in reports
where exhaustive information was required in
condensed form.  It would be more than necessary
for him to send Ferlie a wedding present.
</p>

<p>
Nothing impersonal could prove of interest in
the ancestral halls of Mainwaring.  Yet, there did
not seem to be any personal message that Ferlie
would be likely to welcome from him at the moment.
A younger man had felt more cause for resentment,
that Ferlie, during the short intimate moments when
she hailed their recovered friendship, had not
confided in him her intention of marrying this man.
Cyprian was, himself, incapable of resentment
against her, however well-deserved.
</p>

<p>
By chance, he caught sight of something in a
jeweller's window which attracted him for
unanalysable reasons: it was a small golden apple
attached to a slender gold chain.  By means of a
catch, cunningly concealed under the leaf, it split
in half, revealing a tiny magnifying mirror and a
minute powder-puff.  Round the mirror was
engraved the legend, "To the Fairest."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian bought the apple, caused it to be packed
and sealed, and wrote the address in the shop;
whence he despatched it to Ferlie, omitting even to
enclose his card.
</p>

<p>
She did not acknowledge it but, at least, she did
not send it back.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
With the dawning of her wedding day a fatalistic
calm descended upon his tortured mentality,
preparing him to see the thing decently through.
</p>

<p>
On account of Mr. Carmichael's illness the
ceremony and reception were to be comparatively
"quiet."  But when Cyprian arrived, in response
to exultant bells, at the fashionable church's door,
whence a strip of red carpet protruded like a derisive
tongue, his muffled senses perceived quite a
formidable array of guests in wedding-garments who
ostensibly came to pray and remained to stare.
</p>

<p>
An immaculate gentleman, blandly manipulating
yards of scarlet cords suggestive of a royal lynching,
inquired of him, "whether he were on the side of the
bride or the bridegroom," and, receiving an
inarticulate reply, pushed him into the end of the last
pew and left him to his own devices with a hymn-book.
</p>

<p>
The organ blared joyously, as if the organist
aimed at drowning the torrent of whispering and
the squeaks of enraptured greeting uniting the pews.
</p>

<p>
Here and there, was a face known to Cyprian
through the medium of the illustrated papers.
</p>

<p>
Fragments of conversation were wafted backwards
through the lily-scented air.
</p>

<p>
"The mother really landed him, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the Glennies are furious, and Mona
Glennie says..."
</p>

<p>
"But he was never actually engaged to her, was he?"
</p>

<p>
"Wild oats.  What young man doesn't...
No.  The Vane girl was older than he was.  The
attraction at <i>that</i> establishment was the Samaritan
Actress."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's the first time I have heard a member
of the tribe of Abraham described as a Samaritan."
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand.  Why, she took in the
Vane when all doors..."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian sat back and opened the hymn-book
at random.  Did he feel things more intensely
than these folk and was it a disgrace to be
thin-skinned?
</p>

<p>
Muriel, and now ... Ferlie.  "The One before
the Last."  But Muriel had figured in the life of a
different man from the Cyprian who sat here watching
for Ferlie.  If intense desire could be construed
by the high gods and accepted as prayer, he did
most intensely desire Ferlie to be happy.
</p>

<p>
The buzz of conversation thickened into low
murmurings and died.  The bridegroom had entered
by a side door and was speaking to someone in a
front pew.
</p>

<p>
Almost immediately the Voluntary changed to
Lohengrin's "Wedding March," and a clump of
rose-coloured dresses, presumably belonging to
bridesmaids in the porch, took individual form and
clustered round someone in white.
</p>

<p>
From his post at the back Cyprian had not been
able to gather more than that Ferlie's future husband
was tall and rather thin but, on turning his head now,
his eyes encountered hers fully.  He was startled
by the impression that he was staring into the face
of a perfect stranger.  How ghastly white she looked!
The fraction of a moment and the eyes dropped,
even as his own had dropped before hers the night
she had wished to keep him at her side.
</p>

<p>
She was passing by on Peter's arm.  The pair of
them looked as if they ought still to be going to
school.
</p>

<p>
Peter's face wore precisely the same expression
as must have adorned it when he first took his place
at roll-call among the sixth-form "Bloods."
</p>

<p>
The bridesmaids twittered behind large bouquets
of sweet-peas.
</p>

<p>
Everybody was standing.  Everybody was howling
a hymn, what time all craned their necks and stealthily
mounted hassocks to stare at Ferlie ... Ferlie,
who hated people to see her at emotional moments....
He would wake in a little while to find her
beside him, seeking shelter from the Thing which
had whitened her face with terror....
</p>

<p>
"Dearly Beloved, we are gathered together in the
sight of God..."  Ah, well, if the man thought so.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian felt certain that, whatever God had seen
fit to do in Cana of Galilee, He was not presiding
amongst these wedding-guests.
</p>

<p>
Every now and then a gap in the swaying pews
would give him a glimpse of Ferlie's mother dabbing
at her face with a handkerchief, in token that she
must be regarded as bereft of a daughter against
her will.  At intervals, she was, doubtless, thanking
God that she had done her duty.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian again sought refuge in the hymn-book.
</p>

<p>
The mutterings up at the altar were stilled and
various people had escaped from confinement to
wander through the vestry-door in the wake of the
chief actors in this religious farce.  Or was it
tragedy?
</p>

<p>
While bitter thought was crowding thus against
bitter thought in his mind, his gaze became
involuntarily fixed upon the lines of the hymn the choir
was singing to fill in time:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O Perfect Love, all human thought transcending!<br>
  Lowly we kneel in prayer before Thy Throne,<br>
  That theirs may be the love that knows no ending<br>
  Whom Thou for evermore doth join in one."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
But&mdash;Good Gracious!&mdash;thought Cyprian, in the
light of blinding revelation, he and Ferlie did not
need all this to make them one.  They had always
known that they were one, united by some mystic
Force which had its roots in a Far Beginning and
its branches in the Eternities.
</p>

<p>
Then why were they building these barriers
deliberately between them and their united freedom?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "With childlike trust which fears not pain nor death."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
He had missed the rest of the second verse, but that
last line was a perfect description of Ferlie's approach
to Love in the abstract.  (The woman in front of
him would not stop sniffing.)
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Grant them the joy which brightens earthly sorrow,<br>
  Grant them the peace which calms all earthly strife;<br>
  And to Life's day the glorious unknown morrow<br>
  That dawns upon eternal love and life...."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was over.  In a dream he had seen her flit
by him, glancing neither to the left nor to the right,
but this time she was not clinging to Peter.
</p>

<p>
With her departure the church became a happy
tumult of rising sound.  The organist had pulled
out everything in the diapason line that his fingers
could reach, and Cyprian escaped along the flower-strewn
carpet, and so to his taxi, with a great longing
upon him for the silence of catacombs.
</p>

<p>
The philosophic sensations which had followed his
sleepless night were no proof now against his
throbbing nerves.  Ferlie, also, he remembered,
experienced physical suffering in mental sorrow.
The knowledge formed another of the cobweb-threads
binding them to one another.
</p>

<p>
In Mrs. Carmichael's drawing-room people were
now shaking hands with her.  There was more noise
and a great deal of affected laughter.  Cyprian,
avoiding the Family, including the uplifted Peter,
slipped into an ante-room in search of whisky and
soda.
</p>

<p>
He could not face Ferlie before all that crowd.
He could not.
</p>

<p>
From the ante-room he made his way to an apartment
containing a bowl of goldfish.  He remembered
it commanded a view of the stairs.  If she passed
up or down the staircase, unattended, he might
reasonably expect to have her for a moment to
himself.  He waited for a long while, watching the
goldfish go round and round in circles.  They
roused misty recollections of Ferlie's nonsensical
talk of the general imprisonment of human spirits.
</p>

<p>
When she did come, although she passed right
through the room in her white veil and flowing
draperies, he nearly failed to step forward from that
sheltered corner by the bookcase.
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie!"
</p>

<p>
She started violently and swung round.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  It's you, is it?"
</p>

<p>
She spoke on a high-pitched delirious note.
Naturally, people were agreeing any girl would be
over-excited who had achieved this marriage.
</p>

<p>
Her whole appearance shocked Cyprian, who knew
the real Ferlie.
</p>

<p>
"I never acknowledged your gift, Cyprian.  The
Apple of Discord.  Clever of you to think of that.
Not that I needed a material reminder of the fact
that you and I had at last experienced ... shall
we call it a misunderstanding?"
</p>

<p>
The words raced one another to a close, and she
ended on the edge of shrill laughter.  He flinched
as if she had struck him in the face.
</p>

<p>
The tale of their years for that instant reversed,
he looked back at her with the eyes of a hurt and
bewildered child.  Shaded them with his hand
against the pain as he replied:
</p>

<p>
"You know that is neither fair nor true."
</p>

<p>
"I no longer know what is true," said Ferlie.
</p>

<p>
Half beside himself with the sight of her thus
altered, he caught her wrists and held them.
</p>

<p>
"Because you have formed a new and all-absorbing
tie for the future, is it necessary to mock
at that older discarded friendship which stretches
out a hand to you from the past?"
</p>

<p>
A slow flush crept up her face and the grey eyes
widened on a look of anger and intense pain.
</p>

<p>
"Mock?  No, Cyprian, I am not Muriel Vane&mdash;kind
to men in order to be cruel.  If I seem to
indulge in that particular vein of cruelty, it is because
I know of no other way to be kind ... now."
</p>

<p>
He saw the thin gleam of a gold chain which lost
itself in the folds of transparent softness near her
throat, and was superseded by a visible string of
pearls&mdash;"the gift of the Bridegroom."
</p>

<p>
Then she wrenched herself away and left him
there, staring uncomprehendingly at the goldfish
going round and round.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p>
Cyprian did not return to the flat.  He went out
into the restless London streets.  Block after block
he passed, from the more fashionable quarters to
the outskirts of the park, walking swiftly to escape
pursuing Memory, until at last the damp darkness
of the river divided the myriad scintillating eyes of
the city.
</p>

<p>
Further along the Embankment dead forms lay
huddled where the shadows lay deepest, every now
and again to start erect, galvanized into life by the
angry flash of a police-lantern.
</p>

<p>
As he paused to strike a match against a stone
bench, shaped like an incompleted coffin, one of
these corpses twitched itself upright.
</p>

<p>
"Fit ter drop!" it muttered, still in the throes of
uneasy slumber; "Gawd! fer one bloody night
to fergit meself in."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian replaced his pipe in his pocket and
fumbled.
</p>

<p>
"Here," he said, "I don't know who you are,
and you don't know who I am, but if you, too, are
in need of sleep and a little forgetting, go and buy
it with this, which will not buy it for me."
</p>

<p>
With the astonished gratitude of a "Gawd bless
yer bleedin' eyes, Gov'ner" (even here it was God,
God, God, thought Cyprian, who refused to be shut
out of Man's tortured intellect even while it
anathematized His works) this invisible wreck of Humanity,
made in His image, slouched away to drink itself
blind to sorrow for a short time in some starless
rat-hole known only to its kind.
</p>

<p>
And Cyprian sat and smoked on the deserted seat,
still redolent with the effluvia of rotting rags, until
a suspicious arc of light searched him out in his sins
and a voice, hoarse with hectorings, commanded
him to move on.
</p>

<p>
Morning found him so far from home that a
sleepy taxi-driver whom he hailed rolled a jaundiced
eye on receiving the directions of this individual
whose damp, crumpled clothes and unclean collar
showed unmistakable evidence of an unusual brand
of night-on-the-tiles, and Cyprian was obliged to
disburse half the fare in advance.
</p>

<p>
His physical exhaustion stood him now in good
stead and he slept deeply on the shabby leather
cushions the whole way back to the flat.  Slept again
on his undisturbed bed, afterwards, till the
scandalized valet roused him for tea; his first meal in
twenty-four hours.
</p>

<p>
Before he set sail for the East, he made one
attempt, and only one, to renew correspondence
with Ferlie.
</p>

<p>
The letter conveyed nothing to her of the true
state of his mind.  In despair he had closed it on a
pathetic admission, "I fear I have no gift of
expression."  She answered him, but her own methods
of expression were, as usual, fantastic.  In the letter
she enclosed a small gold key.  "A gift for a gift,
Cyprian.  I suppose it was inevitable that you should
shut the gates upon me.  I send the sign that only
you can unlock them."
</p>

<p>
He placed the key upon his watch-chain, and,
with Herculean efforts of self-control, refrained from
any attempts to discover her meaning.
</p>

<p>
She had always been such a rebel; she had always
been so sure of the light within her and, alas, she
had always been so sure of the light within him.
</p>

<p>
A few weeks later, when, the honeymoon accomplished,
Ferlie and her husband had returned to
town, Mr. Carmichael died.
</p>

<p>
The operation proved successful enough but,
somehow, he never really rallied.  Perhaps the
predominant feeling that his day's work was now
ended lessened the incentive to live.
</p>

<p>
He smiled with grim satisfaction the afternoon
Peter came to see him; a Peter who had already
begun to regard the Human Form Divine in the
same light as the Butcher regards the liver and
kidneys which he slaps down upon the marble slab
to dissect for purchasing housewives; a Peter who
would be decidedly happier using the knife than
saving the unwary limb that might stray his way.
</p>

<p>
Peter's hair was untidy, his eyes bloodshot, his
collar unhygienic, and his finger-nails in
half-mourning.  His appearance was altogether
unsterilized and self-assured.  He cried, with a loud
voice.  His opinions on certain experimental operations,
his criticisms on those neighbouring embryo
surgeons at work on the same yellow preserved leg
as himself, his versions, punctuated with spasms of
hearty merriment, of the latest hospital yarn,
portraying his fellow-students as a set of inquisitive
young ghouls more triumphant over an eminent
physician's sponge forgotten in a victim's intestines
than troubled with sympathy for the latter's bereaved
relatives.
</p>

<p>
"And I'll tell you exactly what they did to you,
Father; it's old Gumboil's favourite amusement.
First he cuts open the..."
</p>

<p>
"Peter, I am surprised at you!" broke in his
horrified mother.
</p>

<p>
Thus had the path of Peter been made smooth
and his way plain by Ferlie's brilliant marriage.
</p>

<p>
"I staked little enough on her," said Mr. Carmichael,
relishing the jest of Martha and Mary's
antiquated establishment.  "Your mother was
mistrustful of education for her own sex; she did quite
well for herself without it, didn't she?  Ferlie seems
to have justified the conviction that the old-fashioned
girl gets the matrimonial plums.  At any rate,
you will owe your sister a good deal.  See that she
stays happy."
</p>

<p>
Of his son-in-law, whom he only saw once, he
said very little.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible to judge them by the young men of
my day.  This type did well enough in the War
crisis."
</p>

<p>
He did not leave his wife badly off.  With Peter
on the way to being floated, and Ferlie secure, she
had her widow's pension to herself, besides a little
private means and the sum the big town-house
eventually fetched when Ferlie bought it, pandering
to a dream of her mother's that Peter might one
day practise there and retain the Carmichael traditions
in the old setting.  Till that satisfactory day
it could nearly always be sub-let.
</p>

<p>
Somewhat doubtful of the Christian aspect of her
husband's expressed desire for cremation
Mrs. Carmichael, while respecting his wishes, determined
that the rest of the funeral obsequies should be
sufficiently orthodox to disarm his Creator.
</p>

<p>
"No proper tombstone, you see," she complained
damply to Ferlie.  "The design should, so obviously,
have been a severe cross, quite plain, with perhaps a
weeping angel praying.  Then a dove of peace
hovering, and maybe a few lilies.  The simpler the
better, you know.  And a scroll at the foot, or an
open book with one of those grand old texts&mdash;Isaiah,
is it, or Ecclesiasticus?&mdash;anyway, one of the
Prophets&mdash;'Fear not for I have redeemed thee.'  So
comforting.  Or else the one about panting for
living waters that always makes me feel thirsty
myself.  Your dear father was so fond of rhetoric."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie, not quite sure whether the weeping angel
was destined to wear a delicate semblance to the
bereaved wife, nor convinced that the cross could be
considered suitably symbolic of the faith of one who
had ever regarded it as the undeserved gibbet,
brought upon him by himself, of a well-meaning
Eastern agitator nearly two thousand years ago,
was inclined to demur.
</p>

<p>
"Father never evinced either the slightest fear
of his condemnation hereafter, nor any faith in an
ultimate redemption," she protested, "and I think
it would have been rather hypocritical to parade a
thirst for living waters after death in anyone who can
hardly be described as having gasped for them
during life."
</p>

<p>
Then, responding to her mother's grievously
shocked demeanour, she relented into explanation.
</p>

<p>
"I think I never admired Father so much in his
life as I did at his death.  He closed his eyes,
restfully and unfearingly, upon the consciousness
of work well done and principles truly upheld.
What business is it of ours if they were mistaken
principles?  So many people, who profess to cling
to the creeds supported by the Churches, live as if
they had none, and then drift out on a tide of terrified
remorse and shame.  But, personally, I would not
feel fit to intercede for Father's 'forgiveness,' if he
really requires to be forgiven for being true to his
lights."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie's mother was too religious to see it, and,
since it seems to follow that the brighter the hope of
Eternal Life, the blacker the garb in which it must
be approached, there was much melodious moaning
at the bar when her husband's ashes were interred
upon the shores of that Eternal Sea which brought
us hither and upon which, in imagination, she had
safely launched his sceptical soul.
</p>

<p>
A week later she was still sewing bands of crepe
on to Peter's various coats and seeking consolation
in those little details of mournful respect she was able
to accord her Dead.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
In due course, Aunt Brillianna, returning from
the uttermost ends of Italy, was overwhelmed by the
volume of water which had poured under the Family
Bridge during her inexcusable retirement.
</p>

<p>
As the younger relatives, who had expectations
at her hands, remarked: "Anything might have
happened to her at her time of life."  Why, Death
had happened to her nephew!
</p>

<p>
To Ferlie at the Black Towers she went: that
historical country residence of long-ago
Greville-Mainwarings.
</p>

<p>
The place bored Clifford, Ferlie informed her,
and just now he was obliged to be in town.
</p>

<p>
Clifford let her do what she liked at Black Towers,
so long as she did not offend old Jardine, the retainer
who acted as head seneschal and cherished
insurmountable objections to innovation of any kind.
</p>

<p>
"It's a grim-looking pile," said Aunt Brillianna,
sniffing the odour of musty armour in the subdued
hall.  "You look as if you had been living among
ghosts, child."
</p>

<p>
"It's quite natural that I should not look very well
just now," said Ferlie.
</p>

<p>
And Aunt B. scolded herself for not having
foreseen that it would be so.  Family Name to
carry on and all the rest of it.
</p>

<p>
But where was this Clifford?  A flattering portrait
of him&mdash;life-size, in oils&mdash;blocked one end of
the dining-room.  She studied it for a long time;
made a few non-committal noises; reserved her
opinion until she had scrutinized his Father and
Grandfather in the long Gallery above.  And when
she had made up her mind she still reserved her
opinion for the benefit of her own reflection in the
bedroom mirror.
</p>

<p>
"Presentably aristocratic.  On the downward
grade.  Will Ferlie act as a strong enough brake,
even with a child in her arms?  Lord!  What a
mouth!  A few more years shall roll and then
if degeneracy does not set in I'll&mdash;anyway, I'll
leave Ferlie all my emeralds," resolved the old lady.
</p>

<p>
She would hardly have been reassured could she
have seen the original of the portrait at that instant
in Ruth Levine's flat.
</p>

<p>
"And Peter?" inquired Aunt B.
</p>

<p>
"Peter, when he is not classifying the internal
machinery of some antiquated corpse, is examining
Roman Catholicism."
</p>

<p>
"Whatever for?" asked Aunt B. interested.
</p>

<p>
"For the fun of listening to Mother arguing against
it, I think," said Ferlie, unenthusiastically.  "I
told Mother that, if her views were really so strong,
she had better tell him that she had no objection to
his conversion."
</p>

<p>
Aunt B. chuckled.  "You have become very wise
in your generation, Ferlie.  And did she?"
</p>

<p>
"She could not resist correcting the term to
'perversion'," said Ferlie, "and it would have been
so easy to have kept it at 'vert'."
</p>

<p>
"Her father, the bishop, must often have shown
himself impressively sarcastic upon the query, 'Can
there any good come out of the Vatican?'" mused
Aunt B.  "And your mother always had an
indefensible memory for things best forgotten."
</p>

<p>
"What on earth does it matter to anybody but
Peter?  His argument is that, as he has no time
to go into the matter of a Personal God's existence
thoroughly himself and is by no means convinced
that the same Deity has ceased to exist at the bidding
of admirable rationalists like Father, it is best for
him to join a cocksure religion, wherein he knows
what he has got to believe and he knows what he
has got to do.  I think Peter could only be held by
a religion that was cocksure.  And he is, also, a
little mistrustful of his own judgment these days,
and certainly all for strengthening the matrimonial
chain."
</p>

<p>
"And your own views, Ferlie?"
</p>

<p>
"To give according as one receives," said Ferlie
wearily.
</p>

<p>
Far from satisfied was Brillianna Trefusis on her
way back to town.  She had been told that Cyprian
Sterne had shown little or no interest in Ferlie's
affairs and her shrewd brain was being interrogative.
What had he thought of this marriage who knew
the Ferlie-nature so well?
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps&mdash;Another Woman," reasoned Aunt B.,
"though, somehow, the idea does not fit.  I used
to consider the situation dangerous because the child
got such little understanding at home.  But, apart
from the difference in ages, those two 'belonged'."
</p>

<p>
Then she warned herself that her imagination
was getting out of hand.  Ferlie, at present, would
have been more unnatural without moods than with
them.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Who could tell that, on opposite sides of the
Equator, Ferlie and Cyprian were both battling against
that apathy which descends, like a canopy of darkness,
upon ultra-sensitive spirits who have reached
their limit of controlled mental suffering, blinding a
vision ordinarily (since the high gods are just)
unusually clear to distinguish between immortal
and merely mortal beauty, and affecting them with
that terror, however diffidently one may approach
the Example, which wrung a cry of agony from the
Leader of all Christs, whose lips were silent in the
utmost extremities of bodily pain?
</p>

<p>
And these, as yet devoid of the Christ-Power
assured to every struggling heart that responds
to its stirring, whose sun is withdrawn and who
possesses no artificial light to relieve the paralysing
blackness of the Shadowy Valleys of Self-mistrust,
may well lose their way in strange unexplored by-paths
before they win through into the open country
to find the dawn-star shining still above the distant
hills.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<p>
Up the valley, beyond the well-established mines,
where Burmese, European and International pariah
digs the disguised jewels from Earth's mountainous
breasts, Cyprian sat limply in an office with red
wooden walls, smiling to himself at the remembrance
of the untravelled folk who might picture
ruby-mining as a series of endless descents into
Aladdin's cave.
</p>

<p>
The washing of the ruby dust was about the most
interesting part.  The routine work and the daily
examination of the naked coolies, who had even been
known to swallow promising earth-stained lumps of
treasure, in the hope of secreting them later for
private exploitation, very soon lost its excitement.
The rough surroundings and dusty atmosphere were,
in themselves, the ordinary lot of colonists and
pioneers, but the average man had some purpose for
their endurance.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian was conscious of none.  He sometimes
asked himself, seriously, what he had done in
binding himself to drive, interminably, another
man's plough.  There appeared to be no reason why
he should remain, save the natural reluctance of
his type to look back before the furrow was run.
And that might not be for some while yet.
</p>

<p>
His Company's mine, a small one, had been a
secret discovery above the area in those wilds where
the mines were supposed to reach.  He contrasted
the life he had chosen with that of the average
business man.  The roads he travelled from the
green banks of the Irrawadi, more than fifty miles
into the interior, lay through a bewildering loveliness
of mountain pass and rocky defile.
</p>

<p>
The country on either side of the river, steaming
down which one encountered the unique floating
villages of the log-raftsmen, remained primitively
Eastern the whole way to Bhamo, where Burma
joins hands with China.
</p>

<p>
The philosophy of Gautama's fatalistic children
was beginning to soak into Cyprian's ego.  From
this point of the valley, breathing incessantly an
atmosphere of absorbing toil connected with those
open workings from which the Byon, or ruby-earth,
was hauled up by washers of half a dozen different
nationalities, he grew almost able to persuade
himself that Ferlie's England of tall houses and
dignified streets humming with modern traffic,
belonged to a lost pre-existence.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, after three more years of monotony
endured on lethargic river-boat, irresponsive mule-back,
or at the inexorable office-desk, always, more
or less, drawn apart from his fellow-men, he
suspected that it was nearing the time when he should
be born again.  It was so long since he had slept
well at night.  Sometimes he imagined the pain in
his heart had lulled, but each mail-day, blank of
news he did not expect, roused it again.
</p>

<p>
He could have remained longer at head-quarters
now, had he so chosen, but Cyprian never really
fitted in with his pioneering countrymen of the
East, and round about his part of the world there
were few women.
</p>

<p>
Burma had solved the problem of loneliness for
the forest officers and others in her own particular
way.  And Cyprian, in the noonday of his life,
tormented by insomnia, had begun to look upon it
as an inevitable way.
</p>

<p>
A dull throbbing ache in his temples made him
lay down his pen.  He could take Leave, of course.
The idea nauseated him.  For what reason should
he wish to take Leave now?  Even if Ferlie were
unhappy with the tall futile individual he had seen
her marry, what could Cyprian do?  For him the
road stretched thus solitary to the end of the horizon,
lengthened by the fruitless wooing of the sleep that
had deserted his tired plodding brain.  If he stopped
working, inaction would only increase the pressure
of thoughts which work held at bay.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
And then ... the thing happened so quickly.
There was no battling with decisions; no weighing
pros and cons, and the Daimon had simply held its
peace.
</p>

<p>
One day as he walked up the hill to his inelaborate
bungalow he began to nurse a delirious fancy that
the Country, herself, was holding his head in an
iron grip, and only the Country herself could draw
out those claws pressing into his temples on either
side.
</p>

<p>
And, when he reached the four-roomed residence,
the Country Herself was awaiting him, as it had
awaited, to some purpose, many another transplanted
Briton whose national sense of proportion had become
blunted after long rooting in alien soil.
</p>

<p>
She sat there, patiently, outside the dyed bamboo
chick, a lemon-coloured <i>lungi</i> swathed about her
hips, a white muslin jacket concealing her contours,
and frangipani blossoms nestling like stars in the
midnight of her hair.  Her age, was, perhaps,
sixteen, but her smile revealed that placidity of soul
suggesting many adventurous incarnations.  They
called her Hla Byu, or Beauty Fair.
</p>

<p>
Her father was with her: a practical, soft-spoken,
obliging old gentleman, who had heard the Thakin
was a lonely Thakin, and unmarried, and thought
that, for the exceptionally reasonable sum of Rs.200
something might be arranged to the mutual advantage
of all parties.
</p>

<p>
Some atrophied instinct tried to whisper dead
words to Cyprian's wearied spirit as he paused in
the doorway, one hand separating the rattling strands
of bead and bamboo, to gaze at Hla Byu with bodily,
but not mental, concentration.  In response to that
fixed regard her smile intensified, becoming a happy
thing reflected again in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Ohe, Thakin "&mdash;and her voice was honey-soft&mdash;"It
may be in my hands to heal the river-fever."
</p>

<p>
Thus he construed the quick-spoken sentence.
His smarting lids were lowered in token that he did
not wish to argue the matter to its close.  But he
held aside the pattering curtains for her to enter
and let them fall again behind him with the noise of
dried leaves laughing in a hot breeze.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
From the first the experiment acted as a narcotic.
He had never discussed with other men of his
acquaintance the modes and methods employed by
all who adopt what is generally known as the Burma
Habit.
</p>

<p>
During the War, just after his own swift flight from
the mines to the trenches, and his almost immediate
rejection after that early knock-out, an opportunity
had been afforded him, by chance, of observing the
question from the viewpoint of the British soldier.
</p>

<p>
It clothed in an unearthly beauty what had, till
then, struck Cyprian as wholly sordid and unclean.
But that soldier had certainly taken part in an
exceptionally pathetic human drama, which he
proceeded to relate with the utmost <i>naiveté</i>, flavoured
by almost untranslatable epithets of Tommyese.
</p>

<p>
One travelled third in trains those days unless one
was the engine-driver or had made a corner in lead
before it became the staff of life.
</p>

<p>
There was a lot of khaki coming up from Southampton;
tired, wet-looking khaki which had seen
better days but none so worthy of its cloth.  It
steamed with damp because the Mother Country
had greeted the shipload of travellers from across
the Channel with her customary flood of hopeless
tears.  The slippery platforms were picturesque,
after a fashion, from behind a window-pane of the
lingering train.  It was waiting for the hospital
train to leave first.
</p>

<p>
Then three soldiers had stopped outside Cyprian's
carriage window.
</p>

<p>
"'Old 'ard, mates," said a voice, checking his
companions from further exploration, "this 'ere is
practically hempty."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian retired behind his paper as, with squelching
boots and reeking bundles, they proceeded to
instal themselves.
</p>

<p>
"Bit of orl right, eh?" sighed the first with a
creek of content as he settled down to scrutinize
the grey streaming pane.  "The very rain smells
different."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian had scented an Optimist.
</p>

<p>
"Hell!" was the reply in startlingly convincing
tones, "I'll be floated out o' me blasted boots if I
tries to stand up again."
</p>

<p>
This was obviously the Pessimist.
</p>

<p>
"All the same, them boots could take the prize
at the beauty show if Hathi's 'ere was put alongside
'em for comparison," declared the Optimist, giving
a poke at the footgear of Number Three.
</p>

<p>
His were certainly gaping in all likely and unlikely
places, while with the size of them one rightly
connected the mode of address.  The Hathi
smiled absent-mindedly as a man used to exciting
comment upon extremities, in more senses than
one.
</p>

<p>
"'E keeps 'is like that a-purpose to show 'is
Archiebald socks," commented the Pessimist,
disgustedly.  "I ain't 'ad so much sock on me nine
toes for six months as the Hathi 'as kep' on 'is corns
for the 'ole of the last push."
</p>

<p>
"You ought ter 'a kep' that missin' toe to sell,
you ought," chaffed the Optimist.  "We could 'ave
'ad a auction in barricks after the last big Bosch
fungeral, always supposing we git barricks over our
'eads once more in the sweet By 'n By."
</p>

<p>
The Pessimist snorted.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't miss 'em none if we didn't," he stated
flatly.  "It's my belief they'll be so sick of the sight
and stink of soldiers that they'll disband the bloomin'
army."
</p>

<p>
"Always s'posin' there's any army left to disband,"
volunteered Hathi in the soft even tones of the
philosopher.
</p>

<p>
"One can't but 'ope," said the Optimist, producing
a square packet from an inner pocket and proceeding
to unwrap it.  "'Ope and smoke is all the army 'as
to feed on these days."
</p>

<p>
"'Ullo!" broke from the Pessimist, as the packet
revealed cigarettes; "where d'ye raise that,
Rooseveldt?"
</p>

<p>
"These 'ere," returned the fortunate possessor,
"was give to me by 'oo might be called a member
of the yaller Fair Sex and I've 'ad 'em treasured in
oilskin the best part of a year waiting for this
moment."
</p>

<p>
"An' we'll 'ope for 'ooever was with you at the
moment," suggested the Pessimist.
</p>

<p>
His companion shook his head sadly.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't allowed the privilege of sharin' wi' you,
matey," he said, "though with a generous nature
like mine the situation goes crool 'ard.  Fact is, I
took a oath to smoke these with me solitary self on
the first day I set foot on the 'ome shores&mdash;always
s'posin' I 'ad a foot left to set on 'em."
</p>

<p>
"That sort of oath is 'ated in 'eaven," said the
Pessimist, incredulous.
</p>

<p>
"It's 'ated worse on earth," replied the Optimist,
eyeing him speculatively.
</p>

<p>
The Philosopher spoke.  "Why don't you buy a
penny packet of fags if you want 'em?  I see a
Mother's Darling runnin' round jes' now wiv a
right pritty lil tray.  I wouldn't want anyone's fags
'oo didn't want me to 'ave 'em."
</p>

<p>
"You correck that," commanded the Optimist
threateningly.  "I tell you it's a slap-up genuine
affydavid that stands in my way.  'Ave you ever
known me refuse a pal me own wipe&mdash;alway' s'posin'
'e was in the kind o' trouble wot needed a wipe?"
</p>

<p>
Apparently they hadn't, for the Philosopher
prodded him gently in the belt with the toe of his
boot by way of stemming his rising indignation,
and the Pessimist hung unresentfully out of the
window.
</p>

<p>
"This way, sonny," he yelled, on sighting the said
Mother's Darling.  "'Urry your twinklin' tootsies!"
</p>

<p>
But the cigarette boy did not hear.
</p>

<p>
"Try 'im with 'Cuthbert'," advised the Optimist
sympathetically, "or Rodney.  Rodney is a nice
name," he mused.  "I once 'ad a gawd-child named
Rodney.  It died o' croup."
</p>

<p>
"O blast the bloomin' train!" (in effect)
exclaimed the Pessimist impatiently as the engine
showed signs of restlessness.  "'Ere, you!"
</p>

<p>
But the boy sighted him too late as, with a shrill
warning, the engine lurched forward and the long
line of carriages rattled after it, protesting, out of
the station.
</p>

<p>
The Pessimist flung himself backwards with an
unprintable expression.  His nerves were obviously
needing a Woodbine.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have to commit perjury, I suppose," said the
Optimist sadly, handing him the oilskin-guarded
case.  "It's punishable by law but I'll look to you
and Hathi to bail me out."
</p>

<p>
"Quit foolin'," commanded the Philosopher,
"and tell us, afore we help ourselves, wot's makin'
you so greedy-like the very day you ought to be bustin'
to share your soul with your pals?"
</p>

<p>
"Always s'posin' they ain't got none of their
own," murmured the Optimist, throwing him a box
of matches.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't foolin'.  There's a regular romance
about them cigarettes you indelicate spirits is about
to enjoy without appreciatin' of."
</p>

<p>
"Regular your Granny!" growled the Pessimist.
"Which of your beauty gals robbed Dadda's case
for this little lot?  Why, they're Burmese!" he
finished in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
For answer the Optimist nodded to Hathi.
</p>

<p>
"You was up at the Daggone a fair piece?"
he inquired.
</p>

<p>
Hathi reflected.
</p>

<p>
"When we was quartered at Rangoon?  You bet!"
</p>

<p>
"You'll mind them festival nights afore the battalion
was ordered for Bosch fightin'?"
</p>

<p>
"I mind all them festivals," broke in the Pessimist.
</p>

<p>
"You minded too many festivals if I don't
mis-remember," retorted the Optimist.  "I 'eard
wot the sergeant said afterwards about you, my
man."
</p>

<p>
"It's a temple wot makes your mouth water, that,"
ruminated the Philosopher, turning the discussion.
</p>

<p>
"It ain't the temple wot affects me that way,"
said the Optimist decisively, "it's wot sits on the
steps."
</p>

<p>
"I ain't seen none to equal the Daggone lot,"
agreed the Pessimist.
</p>

<p>
And, in a flash, behind Cyprian's paper, light broke
upon a vision of the Shwe Dagon Pagoda at festival
time with its flight of steps bright with humanity
in coats of many colours.  Yellow-robed, shaven
priests, gay-turbaned sweet-sellers, picturesque
beggars and always girls, girls.  Girls in soft
lungis of peach-coloured silk, heliotrope, dull-rose
and lemon; for unlike the Hindu woman the
Burmese has an artistic sense of colour highly
developed.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian had never seen a native of Burma crudely
clad.  His thoughts wandered.
</p>

<p>
"She 'adn't got the sort of name a parson could
'a got round his tongue at the font," the Optimist
was saying when he again turned his attention to
him, "Always supposin' she'd want 'im in that
capacity.  She wore them frangipani flowers be'ind 'er
ears.  Woof!  Whot a jolly stink they 'ad."
</p>

<p>
The other two puffed acquiescence.
</p>

<p>
"Used ter remind me of a Putney bus on a 'ot
day," soliloquized the Pessimist, "I once picked
up a lady's 'andkerchief in a Putney bus.  But no
matter...."
</p>

<p>
"That's a tale of 'is gloomy past, that is," said
the Optimist to the Philosopher with a wink.  "It'll
be better kep' in its cawfin."
</p>

<p>
"So'll that yarn of lil Frangipani, if I ain't much
mistook," snapped the Pessimist.
</p>

<p>
A slow grin stole over the imperturbable countenance
of the Philosopher, but he did not speak.
</p>

<p>
"Funny goods, wimmin!" mused the story-teller,
letting the remark pass.  "There's two sorts,
when all's said and done&mdash;the sort a man keeps in
'is 'ome, and the sort a man keeps in 'is 'eart."
</p>

<p>
"Lil Frangipani being the 'earty kind," suggested
the Philosopher.
</p>

<p>
The Optimist searched his inner garments again.
</p>

<p>
"I got 'er 'ere," he said, and half-shamefacedly
produced an envelope containing a few crumpled
snapshots taken with a large-sized Kodak.  He
handed it to the Philosopher in silence and the
Pessimist peered over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I know 'er!" he exclaimed in triumph.
</p>

<p>
The Optimist greeted the information with scorn.
</p>

<p>
"You!" he said.  "Why, she never ain't 'ad
nothin' to do with a gentleman wot Gawd 'adn't
blessed with blue eyes and a pleasant countenance."
</p>

<p>
"Wot's wrong with my countenance?" demanded
the incensed Pessimist.
</p>

<p>
"There ain't nothin' right that I kin see," insisted
the Optimist.
</p>

<p>
"'E got it at the same shop as yours came from,"
the Philosopher gently reminded him.
</p>

<p>
"Wherever 'e got it from 'e was 'ad," insisted
the Optimist.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you call your eyes blue&mdash;" began the
Pessimist.
</p>

<p>
"I don't," interrupted the other.  "But she did,
and that was good enough."
</p>

<p>
"They say them extry small ones is colour-blind
and stone deaf," stated the Pessimist.  "It's along
o' the life they lead."
</p>

<p>
"I've 'eard tell the same o' you," returned the
Optimist, "but I never pays no 'eed to gossip."
</p>

<p>
Again the Philosopher interposed.
</p>

<p>
"We'll take it she wasn't neither," he said
soothingly.  "And anyway you 'appened to be to 'er
taste and she 'appened to be to yours."
</p>

<p>
"We kep' company, as you might say," continued
the Optimist, "for&mdash;'ow long was we stationed there,
Hathi?"
</p>

<p>
"Best part of a year," replied the Philosopher.
</p>

<p>
"So!  Gawd, 'ow time moves along.  I wouldn't
'a bin on-reasonable if the lil gal 'ad kep' 'er 'and
in wi' one or two of the next smartest privates in the
regiment...."
</p>

<p>
"Wot's that?" ejaculated the Pessimist, but the
speaker took no notice.
</p>

<p>
"But s'welp me if she looked at another blighter
the 'ole time."
</p>

<p>
"S'welp me if she didn't!" came from the
Pessimist.  "I tells yer I knows 'er."
</p>

<p>
"And I tells yer, yer never was able to tell one gal
from another, out there," contradicted the Optimist.
</p>

<p>
"I'd know that one in my sleep, anyway," went
on the Pessimist.
</p>

<p>
"That's how you probably know her best," put
in the Philosopher, "it's a touchin' tale of a
too-trustin' little 'eart, I don't think."
</p>

<p>
"Seein' as 'ow you're smokin' her fags..."
began the Optimist.
</p>

<p>
"Let 'im git on with the yarn," remonstrated the
Philosopher.
</p>

<p>
"Garn!" said the Pessimist, "I was only pullin'
of 'is leg.  Wot 'appened to the little picture?"
</p>

<p>
"You've said it," declared the Optimist, mollified.
"She were a picture; in 'er pale yellow lungi, wiv
a blue scarf and the flowers all over 'er on a festival
day, she could 'a walked out wiv the Prince of Wales
and 'ad the folk all lookin' at 'er instead of 'im."  He
sighed dreamy-eyed at the view of Eastbourne
Pier over the Philosopher's head.  "As I say, she
was mighty fond of me," he continued simply.
"And I thought a 'eap too much of 'er even to 'ave
a dekko at any of 'er little friends in pink and blue.
There was one Chinese woman, 'oo 'ad green dragons
on 'er silk coat, and she gave me the R.S.V.P. eye
more'n once, but I was always goin' shoppin' wiv
Mother."
</p>

<p>
"I know that Chinese woman," said the Pessimist
again.
</p>

<p>
"Then don't tell Mother about it," advised the
Optimist.  "The Hathi 'ere, 'e knows too little
about trouble, and you, you knows too much for
your 'ealth.  Well, my gal she 'ad been popular all
'er life and 'ad saved a tidy pile of rupees which she
was for puttin' down my socks, willin'.  'See 'ere,'
I told 'er, 'I can't no-'ow treat you different from
as if you was a lady-maid airin' the pram in 'Yde
Park,' I says.  'You keeps your chinkers, my dear'!"
</p>

<p>
"'Old 'ard," interrupted the Pessimist, "'owd
you talk to 'er in that bat?"
</p>

<p>
"She knew three words of English to six words o'
Urdu," explained the Optimist, "and I knowed two
o' Urdu to one of Burmese.  And our kind o'
friendship did not need talkin' much at that o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"A he-male and a she-female under ninety niver
need none at no o'clock," said the Philosopher
decidedly.
</p>

<p>
"Then came the rumour that we was to shift,"
went on the Optimist.  "I telled 'er, and she sung
out somethink upsettin'.  She wanted me to chuck
the army and join 'er in keepin' 'ouse out Signal
Pagoda way and be as 'appy as two little birds in a
chimbly.  She didn't see as 'ow my missus at 'ome
could be reckoned a just cause or impediment
neither.  She'd got 'er divorce from two 'usbands
easy enough in the past.  Divorce is easy come by,
accordin' to their rules, it seems."
</p>

<p>
"Which, takin' it all round, ain't surprisin',"
said the Pessimist.
</p>

<p>
"I put it to her this way at last.  'See 'ere,
Ladybird,' I sez, ''is Majesty, the Bara Raj, 'e finds 'e
can't do without me sword-arm in a tamasha
agoin' on agin a low-down lot o' soowar ke bachars
called Bosches,' I says.  'The British Raj 'e sends
a chit for Private Cobb to come along and give 'im
a 'and, so naturally I replies, "Anything to oblige."  Now,
'ow could you expect me to do 'im down after
that?' I sez.  'Them Bosches, they've been eatin'
babies and boilin' the Raj's own Aunties in oil," I
sez.  That kind o' soothed 'er and she begins to
see I'd 'ave to go.  'You not come back,' she says.
''Course I come back,' I sez (for you know 'ow one
'as to work wiv wimmin) 'I come back with a necklace
o' Boschy teeth,' I sez, 'and you can wear it
on the next bara din to the Daggone.  That took
'er fancy some but, would you believe it, she didn't
swaller me all at once.  'You not remember me,
'ome," says she, 'you buljao.'  'Never, on your
life!' I tells 'er, 'you ain't the sort a man forgits
easy.'
</p>

<p>
"The next time I sees 'er she brings me the fags,
all wrapped up in oilskin and air-tight in a little tin.
She got me to promise I'd smoke 'em when I were
'ome to keep me from forgittin' 'ow I was to come
back.  They ain't the three-rupee a 'undred kind
as you can smell a mile neither."
</p>

<p>
"The day the orders was 'eard definite I was
a-wanderin' round the wharf takin' a look at the
ship wot was to land the troops Gawd knowed where,
when I seed someone a-hailin' me from a sampan
on the river.  It was jes' after them sampans 'ad
been put out o' bounds because of them two blasted
Crusoes in B. Company wot 'ad drowned themselves
axidentally foolin' round in one.  And they bein' a
disgrace to the regiment in not knowin' ow to swim,
to my thinkin'."
</p>

<p>
"S wimmin' don't 'elp none in that river, bless
you!" said the Philosopher.  "No man ain't never
saved 'oo tries divin' stunts in that current."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you listen," said the Optimist.  "I looked
'ard and I seed that the sampan was full o' fruit,
and on top o' the fruit, perky as Charley's Aunt,
was that little yeller lungi seated.  'Course I answered
the wave o' 'er 'and, when the sampan gits near the
wharf she pointed at the fruit and then to me.  She'd
collected it from all over the shop for me to 'ave on
my journey."
</p>

<p>
"You never giv us none," said the Pessimist.
</p>

<p>
"You'll hear why," replied the speaker.  "No
one could 'a exactly told wot 'appened after that,
but there was a barge comin' down stream, between
the jetty and the sampan, and a steam-launch comin'
up opposite.  The barge got in the way of me view
fust and then everyone 'eard a shout and the barge
let out over its far end with ropes, and then the
sampan swept past 'er with a chunk missin' and a
speck of yeller 'angin' on, while the fruit was floatin'
about on top of the water."
</p>

<p>
"Gawd!" remarked the Pessimist.  "Did they
git 'er?"
</p>

<p>
The narrator paused.  "Some men in a boat
comin' up-stream lugged 'er in," he said.  "The
man wot was rowin' the sampan 'ad gone down,
and so, o' course, they knew they needn't expect 'im
up again inside a week, and then it would be some
miles along the river.  But they got the little gal
ashore and took 'er to the 'ospital.  'Er 'air was
'angin' down and 'er little face was the colour of
the inside of a banana, and 'er silk lungi all tore and
stained green."
</p>

<p>
"What did you do?" asked the Philosopher.
</p>

<p>
"What a man could.  I went round to the 'ospital
and they wouldn't let me up, but I 'eard as 'ow 'er
ribs was stove in.  Through 'er lung they stuck
and that was 'ow they couldn't save 'er."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you see 'er again at all?"
</p>

<p>
"Next afternoon I turned up to inquire, and a
Burmese nurse said the gal 'ad been askin' to see me
as she knowed she was dying.  They took me up.
There was screens all round the bed because she
couldn't get better, jes' like an English 'ospital.
And O Gawd, some 'o them wimmin in the ward as
I passed, didn't they look 'arf ill!  'Wot's this ward?'
I asked the nurse, and an English matron wot 'ad
come to take my name and address said they were
mostly police cases.  She didn't seem to like my
face none, but she showed me to me little friend.
I Gawd-damned the 'ole blasted lot o' them when I
see 'er, an' jes' knelt down and put me 'ands on 'er
little 'ands and sez: 'See 'ere Ladybird, 'ow you
goin' to wear that Boschy tooth necklace if you don't
get well?'  She opened 'er eyes wide as saucers for
a minute, and then she sees me and smiles a baby
twisted smile.  She gasps a bit and I put me ear
down close so's she wouldn't feel it any effort to
speak a piece.  'No buljao,' she whispers, so faint
I couldn't 'ardly 'ear.  'Never on your life!' sez
I, and I meant it.  Then I brings out the fags to show
'er where I keeps 'em in an inner pocket.  She looks
at 'em and, 'Soomoke,' she sez.  I thought at fust
she wanted me to smoke one then and there, and I'd
'ave done it if Gawd Almighty 'ad pointed out as it
was against the rules.  But then 'er tiny fingers
nipped mine an' I kep' still.  'Don't you be afeared,'
I said, 'I ain't goin' to leave you yet,' thinkin' I'd
put my tongue out at the matron if she tried to shift
me.  With that she kinds of seems to settle.
'Soomoke 'ome,' she gasps; and I answers, 'I'll
smoke the bleedin' caseful, beginning the fust day
I sets foot in Blighty, and I'll blow back the smoke
to the East so's all smoke you see think it's my lot
comin' to tell you as I ain't nearly bulgaoed, nor
goin' to'."
</p>

<p>
The Optimist stopped and coughed violently.
Then he got up and fussing with the window-strap
let the pane down with a bang.  The rain had ceased,
and breaths of English Spring blew in across the
wet fields.
</p>

<p>
"These 'ere do irritate the throat after a while,"
said the Philosopher sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"And wot happened next?" asked the Pessimist,
who had no fine perceptions.
</p>

<p>
The man at the window turned on him with
eyes still glistening from the effects of his
cough.
</p>

<p>
"Wot 'appened next?" he repeated scornfully.
"Oh, 'er and me did a barn dance down the ward,
of course!"
</p>

<p>
The Philosopher handed him back his matches
and the photograph which he was re-studying.
</p>

<p>
"It's got to come to all on us," he said thoughtfully.
"And I bet, matey, it come easier to that lil
girl there than if she'd 'ad to face it later without
a pal at 'er side."
</p>

<p>
"That's so," assented the Optimist cheerfully,
but he tucked the tin case of cigarettes away with
reverent fingers.  "What troubles me," he said
confidentially, "is these 'ere pictures.  I can't
'ardly take 'em 'ome to my missus and
explain&mdash;particularly the poser where me arm's aholdin' of
'er waist.  Under the banana tree.  We got 'em
took by a Eurasian mugger wot I'd met."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you show 'em," warned the Pessimist.
</p>

<p>
"It ain't a question o' showin," said his friend.
"You don't know my missus.  She's a-meetin' me
at Waterloo and if she don't turn out me pockets in
the station she'll do it in the bus."
</p>

<p>
"My 'ole Umbrella is meetin' me too," said the
Pessimist, "and she'll find me all ready to tell 'er
that 'ere is the fust petticoat I've brushed agin'
for a twelve-month.  So don't you go suggestin'
nothin' different, in a pally way, if you do 'appen to
be near."
</p>

<p>
"Let's 'ope your pockets'll bear you out if I do,"
said the Optimist.
</p>

<p>
The Philosopher shifted his position and leant
forward.  "You take my tip, 'ole love," he said
impressively to the Optimist.  "Jes' you wipe out
that lil yaller gal.  She's in safer 'ands than yours
now and you can't git at 'er with cigarette smoke,
nor nothin' else.  You tear them photographs right
now and put them out of the winder.  It ain't no
good explainin' 'em to a woman&mdash;least of all to one
wiv marriage lines.  I know, 'cos once I tried it on.
My old missus is one of them earnest Christians wot
do a lot more forgivin' than forgettin', and 'er
forgivin' of me 'as been more'n I can bear for the last
five years.  Now, whenever we 'as words, I git the
wust of it straight off, owin' to the 'andle I giv' 'er
agin' me.  You all of you poke fun at me for bein'
quiet-like, but if you'd seed my missus, or 'eard 'er,
you'd know where I got the 'abit of 'oldin' me tongue.
I go on tip-toe now when there's a gal around 'oo
suits me."
</p>

<p>
The Optimist gazed at him admiringly.
</p>

<p>
"You're deep," he announced with conviction.
</p>

<p>
"Nothin' in me pockets or in me kit," wound up
the Philosopher, "is nothin' on me conscience or
on me wife's, and no bustin' of the 'appy 'ome.
You wipe that lil Frangipani off the slate and forgit
the stink o' them flowers."
</p>

<p>
The Optimist shuffled the photographs thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Seems 'ard," he said, running his fingers round
the rims.  "Still&mdash;'ere goes!"
</p>

<p>
He tore them up slowly and the fragments were
whirled away into space by the draught outside.
</p>

<p>
One small piece floated back to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"This 'ere is the tail of 'er lungi," he said, picking
it up.
</p>

<p>
And then, since there is nothing conceivable in
God's world so sentimental as the British soldier,
he slipped it into the cigarette-case where it could
tell no tales.
</p>

<p>
The Philosopher rose to shut the window for there
was a nip in the air.  He looked back up the line
and down on the footboards where a couple of shreds
still clung.
</p>

<p>
"That the best place for <i>them</i>," he said with
conviction, drawing up the glass.  Then he muttered
a profound truth.
</p>

<p>
"Honesty may be the best policy," he said, "but
it ain't the one wot keeps a weddin'-ring from wearin'
loose."
</p>

<p>
Fortified by which assurance, Cyprian had seen
the three Galahads alight on Waterloo platform,
ten minutes later, each to imprint a chaste salute
on the nearest portion of waiting wife, which
presented itself at the carriage door with a string bag,
a shabby umbrella and dewy eyes.
</p>

<p>
And as, now, in recalling the whole scene which had
deeply impressed him at the time, he compared the
insignia of the string bag with that of the white
frangipani flower, the cynicism of the Greek
Philosopher crossed his mind, who summed up the whole
conditions of life, since male and female created
He them, in the words:

<h3>
CHAPTER X
</h3>

<p>
Hla Byu's outlook was too Eastern to be contemplated
by any woman of the West.  Very much the
dog's point of view.
</p>

<p>
There is endless talk about the faithfulness of
dogs, but does not experience teach that it really
consists of faithfulness to a master rather than to
one master?  The dog who loses one master, to be
kindly adopted by another, suffers from the change
only until he has grown accustomed to the new touch
upon his head.  His heart beats as happily in a
little while to the new tread along the garden walk.
He is still faithful in his allegiance&mdash;to the hand that
feeds him.  When the old master returns he will
remember, till then he will philosophize.
</p>

<p>
The Burmese woman who is sold to the white man
has this advantage over his dog.  The Unexpected
does not occur.  She knows that she will, possibly,
change masters more than once in her life.  She
may prefer one to another, but, in most cases, the
change is accepted philosophically and is followed by
few heart-burnings and useless regrets.  So that
the man be just to her and kind, so that he clothe
her and approve of her housekeeping, she is content.
Her lighthearted affection goes to the children,
who are bone of her bone, and of whom she need
not stand in awe.
</p>

<p>
If the man has any notion of fair play, when the
time comes for him to leave her, he will provide for
the children; if he deny all responsibility, there are
still the missions, who look upon such things with
solemn and sentimental eyes, and are, consequently,
helpful.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian learnt during the next two years to
understand this enduring passivity of the Buddha's
children.  Not that they followed blindly the
precepts of the Great Teacher: they had simply
adapted them to the changing times and needs of
the Race.
</p>

<p>
Little Hla Byu was a regular attendant on festival
occasions at the Aracan Pagoda in Mandalay.
She knelt before the big gold Buddha, solid from
many coatings of precious metal, when the flickering
candles dripped grease, and the scent of the
incense-sticks penetrated through the scent of perspiring
humanity.
</p>

<p>
There, she prayed for her son.  She did not
consciously connect him with the foreign father who
might, any day, desert her for a woman of his own
race, and legitimately deny all that linked him
to his former life.  She prayed quaintly, mechanically,
regarding the proceeding in the light of a
charm, and with no very clear idea as to who should
hear the prayer.  The priests should know.  But
the priests, indeed, if they knew anything up at their
bare stone monastery, should have taught that the
Master could not hear the cry of human suffering
or desire, even if he would, since he had obtained
the final Silence, "where beyond these voices there
is peace."  But, to Hla Byu, spirits there must
be&mdash;Someone, Anyone.  Prayer could do no harm,
anyway, and might certainly do good.  Contemplation
was not for the Burman-in-the-street, but
any follower of the Buddha can hold a wooden rosary
and repeat two thousand times in a dull monotone,
some such golden truth as that "Honesty is the best
policy," before leaving the lighted Pagoda and going
back to the bazaar to cheat his brother.
</p>

<p>
At least, her creed gave some outlet to those
emotions which the practical things of life cannot
satisfy.
</p>

<p>
She was richer than Cyprian, who had none.
The simple honesty of her beautified their
relationship.  Nature, surely, must have meant just this
simplicity between the sexes in ministering to each
other's needs.  He knew that Ferlie would have
been struck with the hypocrisy of Society-life in the
big towns of Burma.
</p>

<p>
There the white women-folk knew of such as little
Hla Byu but pretended ignorance.  No aspiring
mother would encourage her daughter to join hands
with an ex-public-school boy at the beginning of his
career and flit away into the jungles to share the
making of his future.  That was Hla Byu's part.
But, later, when the same future was assured, when
the public-school boy had become submerged in the
fever-eaten official with a bank-book and, possibly,
a passion-ravaged past, then it was the turn of some
clear-eyed débutante to receive with thankfulness
God's gift of a good man's love&mdash;and his motor-car.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Cyprian's face, bent over the official note-paper
upon which he had been idly sketching while listening
to the klop-klop of the postman's mule mounting
the hill, was less lean now and far less strained.
The great bitterness curving the corners of his mouth
was contradicted by the level calm with which his
eyes looked out across to the horizon despite their
awareness that the Lot had fallen unto him in a
rugged ground.
</p>

<p>
A slight stir in the vicinity of the waste-paper
basket caused him to turn his head, and, with an
oddly detached air, he surveyed for some moments
the explorations therein of a naked baby.
</p>

<p>
Its creamy amber skin shone like satin in the
sunlight, relieved by its stiff cap of black hair.
And the eyes riveted suddenly upon Cyprian's
were widely set apart and, most incongruously,
most tellingly, blue.
</p>

<p>
The man, unexpectedly, with a brusque movement
of his head, shook down the eye-glasses he used to
correct his astigmatic vision when concentrating
for long upon close writing, and the small inquiring
face receded, mercifully blurred.
</p>

<p>
But its marked and precocious intelligence
remained branded upon his mentality as if somebody
had pasted an imperfectly-developed photograph
there.
</p>

<p>
"One is responsible," and he turned the word over
in his mind, stupidly probing its meaning.
</p>

<p>
Hla Byu picked up the restless bundle as she
flitted into the shaded gloom of the sitting-room,
out of the white glare blocked by the verandah
chicks.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian absently received his letters from her
hands.
</p>

<p>
"The school is in Maymyo," he said inconsequently.
"It will be best for him to go where
there will be others like him."
</p>

<p>
The puzzled wonderment of her expression merged
into amusement.  She had learnt something of this
man during the last two years.  Something, also,
of latent powers in herself which he would have
paid much, in after life, to have left unstirred.  She
gave a tiny exclamatory chirp of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"At fourteen months, Thakin?  That would,
indeed, be somewhat early, even for him."
</p>

<p>
With relief he recalled that the time for such
decisions was not yet.  One might drift a little
longer....
</p>

<p>
But Fate disproved that.  Among the official
letters lay one in a strange handwriting.  He turned
it over incuriously, but there was a seal on the back
which quickened his interest.  He could not
recollect where he had seen it before.  The first words
of the letter startled him.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Ferlie's Cyprian,"&mdash;Stiffening, he turned
the sheet over to read the signature, "B. Trefusis."  Then
he remembered.  A tea-shop....  Ferlie
buried in ice-cream and, to the right of her, a
vivacious shingled head ... the same seal on a thin
white wrinkled finger, curved over a plate of
honey-coloured scones.  He spread the letter out upon the
blotting-paper and, resting his drawn forehead on
sheltering palms, read it slowly through.
</p>

<p>
"If you were ever a friend of Ferlie's, try and come
to her.  Once, I should have said, if you were ever
a friend of Ferlie's try and leave her.  I never
considered you a successful substitute for the uncle
she did not possess, but the very difference in age
between you, which I deplored, I now rejoice in.
Perhaps, she will confide in you; perhaps, you will
be able to help where the few that are near and dear
to her are excluded from helping.
</p>

<p>
"For all I know, you may have forgotten that there
ever was a Ferlie.  This may find you with another
woman at your side.  You may have ties&mdash;children;
then, for their sakes, come and hold out your hand
in friendship to a child you once knew.  I am not
satisfied with the little I gleaned about her marriage.
I am not satisfied with the accounts I heard of you
then.  The only thing I am satisfied about is that
Ferlie needs you and would tell you what she will
not tell me.  Perhaps, you may have the key to
the whole situation; perhaps, you know nothing.
At any rate, if you were ever a friend of Ferlie's
come and learn."
</p>

<p>
After all, the ties which held him were slenderer
than cobwebs; surprising the ease with which he
snapped them.
</p>

<p>
Hla Byu did not question.  She merely accepted.
But her slanting brows creased painfully.
</p>

<p>
"Will the Thakin let me come back to him?"
</p>

<p>
Through the rising tumult of his mind he detected
the note of alarm.
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing to fear," he told her.  "I will
arrange for regular money to be supplied to you.
The child shall be provided for all during his life."
</p>

<p>
The momentary relief in her face struck a feeling
of shame to Cyprian's soul.  There were men, he
knew, who would consider him quixotic.  He
blinked away the thought.  Custom could not lessen
the dominion of the Daimon in this matter.
Responsible.  For all that he had made of life.  For the
weakness which had originally driven him from his
acknowledged sphere.  For the narrowness which
had spurned Ferlie's confidence in its rightful
setting; for the indecision which had kept him
from following his truest instincts to love and to
declare his love; for the apathetic purposelessness
through which he had accepted Burma's bribe of
Hla Byu, and the child with the questioning blue
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What will happen no one can foretell," he said.
"Serve another Thakin, or wait; in either case
you can always appeal to me for your needs."
</p>

<p>
Seemingly satisfied, she nodded and then turned
from him to hide something on her lashes which
made rainbows of the sunshine.  She had always
been a little afraid of him, although he never got
drunk, nor beat her, nor threw things about the house
as she knew, from her friends, so many foreign
masters did.  He was always silent, work-absorbed,
apart from her&mdash;it was like living with the marble
Buddha on the river-bank, who eternally contemplated,
in the regulation attitude, the water traffic
slipping by on its very mortal affairs, from town to
town.  She clutched the baby to her in a spasm
of passionate regret&mdash;although, of course, there
remained nothing to regret since their future was
assured.
</p>

<p>
"It has been peace here, Thakin?" she said, on
a timid note of interrogation.
</p>

<p>
He laid a gentle hand upon the yielding shoulder;
her tiny bones felt soft like a kitten's bones.
</p>

<p>
"It is never peace for long, child," he answered.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
He had wired the date of his arrival to Miss
Trefusis; the compromise of a reply to the letter
he had not felt capable of answering.  But he was
not prepared to see the severely stately figure of that
decisive lady waiting at the docks.
</p>

<p>
She greeted him as if they had parted yesterday.
</p>

<p>
"People remain vivid to me," she said in explanation,
leading him to the closed limousine.  "We
are motoring to my place near town, and your heavy
luggage can go by train.  You are coming to stay
with me until you've had time to choose your roost.
On the way down in the car I can elucidate.  Meanwhile,
a brief catechism will clear the air.  Married?"
</p>

<p>
Cyprian shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad," said the old lady.  "Your having
no responsibilities will simplify matters.  Was
leave due to you?"
</p>

<p>
"I took 'Urgent Private Affairs'."
</p>

<p>
"Good.  They should more than occupy your
attention.  Get in."
</p>

<p>
Her hand directed him towards the car.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian obeyed, hypnotized.  Once they were
seated she swung sideways to look him full in the
face.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know why I have risked this?  For
love of Ferlie.  You might have consigned me to the
devil, had you developed into an official of high
standing, very much married, with a brace of
inarticulate, spectacled children.  Instinct told me that
you were alone in spirit, even if among your fellow-men;
overworking, and living at the bottom of a
mine, not of rubies, but of buried hopes.  Was I
right?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded, blinking nervously at his hands.
Her voice had lost its hard-edged clarity.
</p>

<p>
"When I saw you two, one afternoon at the Zoo&mdash;you
remember?&mdash;I thought that the link, strengthening
between you as the years went on, was wholly
unnatural.  You were Ferlie's sun, though neither
of you realized it.  And she stood to you for
refreshment and comfort and utter peace.  Again&mdash;Was
I right?"
</p>

<p>
He stirred uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"Can you not spare me this?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Aunt Brillianna emphatically.  "I
can spare you nothing if Ferlie is to be spared a
little.  Listen."
</p>

<p>
She lowered her tone and, above the humming of
the car, her voice ran on earnestly.  Pain was again
wrenching at his nerves and the sentences sounded
blurred and disconnected....
</p>

<p>
"And no one knows the real truth.  They are not,
officially, separated, but she lives alone at Black
Towers with John, her little boy...."
</p>

<p>
A companion of lesser perception might have
faltered discouraged before his immobility.  This
one had the good sense to keep her eyes upon the
shifting hedges.
</p>

<p>
"She tells us nothing, and lives like a nun,
cloistered in her pathetic youth behind the walls
of that crumbling old tomb.  Mainwaring fills the
town house with his friends, and there are queer
stories afloat about him.  He has never shown any
interest in the child&mdash;looks upon its arrival as a duty
mutually performed.  There has been no public
quarrel; no cruelty that we know of, and the
rumours, however unsavoury, do not provide the
evidence for divorce proceedings.  In any case,
Ferlie has joined the Church of Rome.  Gave no
explanation why; merely announced it as an
accomplished fact.  I saw a marble statue once, called
'Endurance.'  It was in a private show, by an
unknown man.  A nude figure with hands extended
to push back some invisible advancing foe.  I
bought it.  There is terror in the face, lest the
unknown power should crush completely; but there
is also cold resistance and the strength of despair.
I will show you the thing.  You, who remember
Ferlie as so poignantly alive...."
</p>

<p>
The speaker broke off for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"... But I must come to the incident which
prompted my letter to you.  I had gone unexpectedly
to Black Towers, and only John greeted me in that
mausoleum of a hall.  He is a Ferlie product all
right, but only just four.  And ... one never
knows....  The servants told me that Lady
Greville-Mainwaring was at home but could not be
disturbed.  I asked if she were ill.  They denied
that and, politely resistant to further inquiries,
supplied me with papers, afternoon tea, and, being
well acquainted with my erratic habits, asked if I
would stay the night.  I said 'yes,' and turned my
whole attention to John in the hope of discovering
what his mother was doing.
</p>

<p>
"'No one could ever go up between five and six,'
he informed me.  'But go up where, John?' I asked.
With some difficulty I extracted the fact that Ferlie
was in the West Tower.  I knew there were unused
rooms in the towers.  I asked him what his mother
did there between five and six, and he said she shut
the door and 'just was quiet,' adding proudly that
he took her up messages if it was important.
</p>

<p>
"I hated the sound of these proceedings which
he evidently regarded as normal.  'This is important,
John,' I said.  'We won't tell anybody else, but
you take me up to Mother.'  He demurred at
first&mdash;thought the occasion did not justify that weary
journey&mdash;but, at last, I persuaded him.  The steps
were high and dark and narrow.  We might have
been perambulating in Dante's Purgatory as we
circled round and round.  We stopped outside the
door of a circular room.  So strict were her orders
that she had ceased to expect intrusion, and only a
curtain hid her from us.  I stood for some while
behind it, listening to the silence.  John, queer
intense little soul that he is, sat down on the top step
nursing his legs, for he was never very strong and
I suppose they ached from the climb.  And suddenly
perched up at that height in the dark, relieved only
by the spears of ghost-coloured light shooting through
the slit windows behind us on the stair, I lost my
nerve and felt that, dishonourable or not, I must
know what Ferlie was doing.  If she had turned
into a witch in that setting I was not prepared to
be surprised."
</p>

<p>
Miss Trefusis stopped to wipe from her face the
dampness which had gathered there.  She gave a
little gasp and moistened her lips.
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian.  I stood and peeped through the
curtain folds at a room soaked in gold light.  I
thought I was demented until I realized that the
rays of the western sun must touch this turret last
of any room in the house, and then they struck
through a round aperture glazed with orange glass.
When no longer dazzled by the discovery I found
Ferlie.  The place was unfurnished save for a
cushioned oak chair in which she was sitting,
motionless as if she had been dead for years.  On
the palm of one opened hand lay a spherical object
which retained at one spot a pin-point of reflected
light like a minute star.  On this it seemed to me
Ferlie's eyes were fixed, and, even when throwing
discretion to the winds, I went in to her she neither
spoke nor stirred.
</p>

<p>
"I stooped low to her face and realized that she
could not be aware of my presence.  She was in
some sort of a trance.  Terrified, my first idea was
to rush for help.  Mercifully, I thought better of it.
I did not know what kind of help was needed.  I
could only guess that Ferlie was self-hypnotized.
But with what object?  And had the thing been
accidental, or deliberate.  Not daring to pick up
what she held in her hand I saw it was a small
golden apple.
</p>

<p>
"I went back to John and asked him where the
nearest doctor lived.  We were some while whispering
while I dug for information, and during that
delay I heard Ferlie give a long sigh.  Back I sped
to her side.  The apple had rolled into her lap
and her body relaxed as I hovered round like a
distracted hen.  Then, to my joy, I perceived that she
was realizing me.  She did not seem astonished,
and lifting her head spoke as if hardly out of a dream.
</p>

<p>
"'Nearly,' she said.  'Very nearly.  But there
is always some Presence standing between him and
myself&mdash;and it is not God.'
</p>

<p>
"I was tactful and apologetic, putting the blame
of my intrusion on to John and pretending I saw
nothing out of the way in finding her in the turret.
</p>

<p>
"But, later, by deduction and confidences half-won,
I arrived at some sort of explanation.  Ferlie
had been dipping deep into the ultra-ancient and
ultra-modern volumes of every species of literature
which stock the Black Towers library.
</p>

<p>
"'Do you believe that mankind have lost the
power of communicating with one another by
thought-transference?' she asked me.  'If they
ever had it,' I said, determined not to encourage
her.
</p>

<p>
"But her face checked my inclination to snub.
</p>

<p>
"'Christ had it,' she said.  'He healed <i>from a
distance</i>, and promised that all He did we might do.
No one seems to have taken that promise seriously
enough to test it&mdash;unless perhaps the Christian
Scientists.'
</p>

<p>
"'I'd prefer to rely upon the twopenny post,
myself,' I insisted.  She shook her head and said,
'That would not be right in my case, Aunt B.  I
may only struggle to attain the fulfilment of the
promise.'
</p>

<p>
"'With whom do you want to communicate by
this unnatural method,' I asked.  But she would not
tell me.  Only by accident I stumbled upon that
item.
</p>

<p>
"Late that same night I heard through my open
window a faint sound of somebody crying.  It was
one of those desperately still star-saturated nights.
I was up in an instant and along the corridor without
waiting for a candle.  Ferlie's room was next to
John's.  Through his open door I watched her,
but this time I did not rush in to put to flight any
stray ministering angel who might be in the offing.
Cyprian, it is a terrible thing to come, unawares,
upon a soul in Gethsemane.  What has lain between
you two in the past I do not know; what may lie
between you in the future I dare not think.  But I
at my eavesdropping post grew colder and colder.
If Ferlie continued much longer to carry this secret
burden I was certain she would go out of her mind.
And I am convinced that whatever the stereotyped
and doubtless to your mind worthy, principles to
which you have succumbed in this matter, no man
can count himself wholly irresponsible whose name
is thus centred in a woman's prayers."
</p>

<p>
The great car swept forward, increasing speed
along a clear stretch of road.  Between the
occupants for some moments there reigned an unbroken
silence.
</p>

<p>
Then Cyprian spoke, still without moving; his
rigidity outlined against the transparent pane.
</p>

<p>
"How far are we from Black Towers?"
</p>

<p>
"We pass within thirty miles of it."
</p>

<p>
"Then...."  Their eyes met.
</p>

<p>
Aunt B.'s head jerked suddenly forward.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you'd understand." ...

CHAPTER XI
</h3>

<p>
The Autumn twilight was thickening with milky
opal reflections when they rolled through the heavy
iron gates of the park.  Gigantic trees shadowed
the curving drive; every now and then sending
a swirl of jewel-coloured leaves to join their brothers
carpeting the soft turf.
</p>

<p>
They passed one copper beech, tinted like the
understrands of Ferlie's hair.  But, though the
grounds were obviously well cared-for, nothing
could relieve a brooding sense of desolation, due
to the over-luxuriant vegetation which darkened
the surroundings of an already dark, if beautiful,
house.
</p>

<p>
Well-merited the name, Cyprian thought, as the
solid old turret towers rose at last, picked out in
inky silhouette against the flaming aftermath of
sunset cloud.
</p>

<p>
Upon the flight of black marble steps a child
was standing; a miniature bull's-eye lamp in his
hands.  He had evidently been trying to light it
with the aid of a box of matches which would not
strike.
</p>

<p>
A footman came down the stairs as the car drew
up, and his expression of surprise gave way to placid
recognition of its lady-occupant.
</p>

<p>
"Her ladyship said she was expecting you,
Madam, but did not think that you would be
arriving till Wednesday."
</p>

<p>
"I have brought a friend of hers with me,"
Miss Trefusis told him.  "Where is she?"
</p>

<p>
The man did not answer; he had turned back
to speak to his colleagues, now gathering about the
limousine.
</p>

<p>
Jardine, the old butler, with the forceful impassive
face, informed them that her ladyship should be
told.  He left them before the hall fire and glided
away.
</p>

<p>
"I always regard him as a sort of Keeper of the
Keys," whispered Miss Trefusis, hysterical with
fatigue and achievement.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian took out his watch as if suddenly reminded
of something, but he did not look at the time; only
at the securing ring of a small gold key dangling
from the watch-chain.
</p>

<p>
"He has been in the Family so many years,"
went on Aunt Brillianna, "that Ferlie says he
believes himself a kind of Influence on the
Greville-Mainwaring destinies."
</p>

<p>
The child, whose lamp one of the footmen had
lighted now, passed through the hall, carrying it
carefully.  She called to him.
</p>

<p>
"Come here, John.  Don't you know me to-day?
Where is your mother?"
</p>

<p>
He was advancing towards her but checked
himself at the inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"She said not to take no one up the stairs," he
informed them with emphasis.  "She are having
a key made for the door."
</p>

<p>
He spoke clearly and with only a slight slurring
of the S's which could not be described as a lisp
but which gave a more human childishness to his
unnatural gravity.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely concealing the effort it cost, Cyprian
raised his head and looked at him.  Yes.  That
hair, also, would have flaunted a rebellious crop
of sunny waves had they been allowed to grow.
He was too white and frail-looking for prettiness
but it was with his mother's wide steady gaze
that he returned Cyprian's survey which shifted
first.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" said Aunt B. on a low quaver of
amusement, "you can't afford to be jealous of
Ferlie's son."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian replied with a vexed laugh,
</p>

<p>
"Don't read me so clearly out loud.  There are
some things a man wishes to hide from himself."
</p>

<p>
She rose, holding out her hand to John.
</p>

<p>
"Take us to the foot of the stairs, laddie.  I do not
want you to go up.  We may hear Mother coming
down."
</p>

<p>
John hesitated, but, finally, led the way, vouchsafing
one piece of news as he pushed back a nail-studded
door.
</p>

<p>
"I have got a tricycle."
</p>

<p>
It gave Aunt B. her opening.  At the foot of the
stairs she turned and gestured to Cyprian, standing
behind her.
</p>

<p>
"The key is not yet made to lock you out," she
reminded him in an undertone.  And aloud to John,
"Show me the tricycle."
</p>

<p>
Was it not yet made?  Cyprian asked himself;
or, rather, would the lock be too rusty for it to
turn, after such long disuse?
</p>

<p>
Up and always up.  And Ferlie climbed thus,
daily, the ascent of her lonely Purgatory for the
little hour when she might unmask her suffering,
and face the truth that her soul was exceeding
heavy.
</p>

<p>
It was a long time to Cyprian before he stood
outside that door.  It had a heavy looped iron handle
like that which turns the latch of a church.
</p>

<p>
He paused but heard no sound within.
</p>

<p>
His hand grasping the ring was steady; the
oaken panels swung back easily under that strong
pressure.
</p>

<p>
She was leaning against the Gothic window, and
the lingering touch of long sun-fingers rested upon
her head in comforting caress.
</p>

<p>
He spoke her name in a whisper.  Her head
turned slowly but she did not move.  So often had
he come to her at this time and, so often, faded back
into the gloaming.
</p>

<p>
His shoulders relaxed as dawned the explanation
for her dumb acceptance of his presence.  He crossed
the threshold with outstretched hands.
</p>

<p>
"My dear ... Oh, my dear..."
</p>

<p>
She crumpled up in his arms, not unconscious,
but sick with shock.
</p>

<p>
The last red ray withdrew from the turret, leaving
them in the gloom of a grave from which resurrection
seemed very far away.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The presence of Aunt B. made all the difference
to the situation.  She effaced herself and entertained
John, but lent a more commonplace air to his visit
than would have seemed possible, in the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
The erratic arrivals and departures of Lady
Greville-Mainwaring's elderly aunt had ceased to
be a matter for comment in the servants' hall.
Jardine palpably respected her uncompromising
utterances; John met her as an equal, and Cyprian
and Ferlie, at peace in one another's companionship
along the garden walks, passionately blessed her
in their hearts.  She had done wisely in warning
Cyprian that Ferlie's appearance must startle him.
She wore the look of some Inquisition victim whom
the torturer's power had reduced to that exhaustion
which ceases to feel.  Instead of the limp body,
incapable of further suffering, Ferlie betrayed a
like condition of soul.
</p>

<p>
"Was this change of religion any use?" Cyprian
asked her.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes might swiftly have become sightless as
she replied, "There was no 'change.'  It had
to be that or Father's way of thinking.  And I
could not trust my small strength with Father's
self-sufficient philosophy.  This represented one
more cage, but a necessary one, if I was to
obtain enough self-discipline to enable me to live.
You know I am not being dramatic.  Sometimes
I thought of that way out, only it did not seem
quite fair to John, until he should be old enough
to understand about heredity and choose for himself."
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you don't make yourself exactly clear."
</p>

<p>
"No.  Well, never mind! ... Peter, by chance,
knocked up against a clever Jesuit.  I do admire
that much-criticized sect, Cyprian.  Their hard
logic; their cold positivity of thought.  This one
thrilled one's sense of humour first by a speech made
to a Church of England padre, which, beginning
on a note of toleration crashed to conclusion on a
chord of glorious bigotry.  'After all,' he assured
his vacillating companion, 'We both serve the same
Master; you in your way, I in His.'
</p>

<p>
"Later, this man was discussing the conversion
of a well-known statesman with Peter.  'He was
too intellectual,' said the Jesuit, 'to be satisfied
longer with less than all the Truth his brain could
assimilate.'  That speech impressed Peter as, doubtless,
it was meant to do, with his tendency to brain-worship.
He, also, began to be sure that the World's
Thinkers, among whom he would like to be numbered
some time, must, universally, find the Whole Truth
here.
</p>

<p>
"And you know, Cyprian, he <i>is</i> clever.  They
did not make the mistake of approaching him on
the sentimental, or even the romantically beautiful
side, of the religion.  He is certainly a more valuable
ally to the Catholic Church than undoctrinal I."
</p>

<p>
"The thing has not yet interfered with Peter's
instinctive love of liberty," Cyprian pointed out.
"Whereas, you and I are, surely, threatened by its
precepts."
</p>

<p>
He went no further.  Not yet had he broached to
her that which he understood to be passing in
Aunt Brillianna's mind; more tentatively in his
own.  But Ferlie smiled with wistful understanding.
</p>

<p>
"There is no public cause for a divorce, that I
know of," she said quietly, "And, apart from
Catholicity, isn't divorce rather impossible as a
solution for Us?"
</p>

<p>
She was placing her finger upon something which
formed the basis of their mutual pride.  They did
not give to take back again, whatever the type of
altar to which they had dedicated the gift.
</p>

<p>
The mockery of her marriage-service struck him
afresh....  "That theirs may be the love which
knows no ending, Whom Thou for evermore doth
join in one...."
</p>

<p>
"Dear," and his voice was vibrant with pain,
"How could you ever have imagined that any public
vows could unite you to him, who were already
part of..."
</p>

<p>
Habit of mind checked him; Ferlie was braver.
</p>

<p>
"Of you," she finished steadily.
</p>

<p>
They walked the whole length of the lawn before
she added,
</p>

<p>
"You did not realize that, Cyprian, while there
was time.  If you had realized it I should not have
been free.  There was no time to give you time to
weigh your love.  When you held back my light
seemed clear."
</p>

<p>
"And I had no light," he said shortly.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't told me whether you now share
these modern views about divorce," she reminded
him.  "Even the Church you nominally belong to
is divided in its opinions on the subject.  Its members
talk very fluently, and go on their way, self-convinced.
Like Peter, who, at nineteen, could talk
himself into that sort of convinced state about
anything."
</p>

<p>
"There are exceptional circumstances..."
Cyprian began, but she stopped him then.
</p>

<p>
"And now you are going to do it!  No, Cyprian.
You must be either 'for' or 'against,' with principle
at the back of you.  Don't you see that everybody's
exceptional circumstances would always be his
own?  That is how the Individual now dethrones
God in favour of himself."
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie, you forget you have not yet told me
your circumstances.  And I have a right to know."
</p>

<p>
He watched her clouded face and waited.  Twice
she seemed about to speak but the constrained
reticence of the past two years still fettered her
tongue.
</p>

<p>
"I have never told anyone," she said huskily.
"I don't know how much I ought to tell.  I only
believe that it may be a divorcing matter, according
to Law; if I had not put myself under Catholic
discipline."
</p>

<p>
He placed his hands on her shoulders and pushed
her down on to a moss-upholstered bench near
which, perched on a pillar, mocked a laughing stone
faun.
</p>

<p>
"You must tell me," he said.  And took his place
beside her, covering her hand with his own.
</p>

<p>
Presently, with an obvious effort, she asked,
</p>

<p>
"You will not have forgotten Muriel Vane?"
</p>

<p>
His fingers contracted and she paused to reflect
that if Cyprian had not remained so true in the
abstract to his First Vision he would hardly have
been Cyprian; and her god.
</p>

<p>
But she could not long mis-read the expression
of raw disgust on his face as she lifted hers.  It
puzzled her.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing would hurt now, Cyprian&mdash;if you
knew.  She is&mdash;not quite normal now.  Not since
a long time has she&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know all that."  His tone was cruelly hard.
"For a long while I would not allow myself to
believe those rumours....  And once I thought to
put her before you!  It is that I shall never
forget."  Even so does a man resent his mistakes on their
object instead of on himself.
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian, don't.  Haven't the years taught you
compassion?"
</p>

<p>
He shrugged that view away.
</p>

<p>
"What compassion is possible, or even right and
decent?"
</p>

<p>
"You may feel inclined to shun a leper but, surely,
you would desire to help him, too?"
</p>

<p>
She surprised him.
</p>

<p>
"What makes you think of it that way?"
</p>

<p>
"Experience," said Ferlie, so low that he hardly
caught the word.
</p>

<p>
She braced herself for explanation.
</p>

<p>
"You once met a woman called Ruth Levine."  She
went on without heeding his start of acquiescence.
"She has been very good to Muriel Vane.
Muriel's people separated; then her mother died.
Her father took to drugs, or something; they were
a queer family, degenerating, like&mdash;like so many.
And Muriel developed into&mdash;what people said.
Ruth thought she had foreseen it and might have
done something to prevent it happening.  I should
have imagined that impossible; often it is caused
by heredity insanity.  Anyhow, she saved Muriel
from the usual kind of 'Home.'  It is always the
woman, Ruth says, who is judged; men so affected
can often live undetected or screened from public
criticism....  Ruth knew Clifford before I married
him and when I concluded that, for John's sake&mdash;if
only for that&mdash;there must be a complete break
between Clifford and myself, she came to ask me
to get divorced, as she had cared for him first.  She
was quite matter-of-fact about it.  I told her that
I could not dream of using the evidence she offered
to supply.  I told her that Clifford and I had privately
arranged to live apart but that I was a Catholic and
it was not in my power to unsay vows once spoken.
I told her that I did not think she understood why
Clifford ought to be in other hands than those of
women.  She looked at me as if I were crazy and
went away....  I&mdash;I don't know any more,
Cyprian."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie's voice had almost vanished.  Suddenly
her head went down upon her knees and her body
shook with dry sobbing.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian, with half-closed eyes which did not wish
to see, was wondering whether he had understood.
</p>

<p>
She had conjured up dark visions the like of which
had rarely crossed his horizon.  He was inclined,
like many self-sheltered individuals, to blink at the
most sinister of Life's shadows, as if by so doing he
could blink them out of existence as easily as out
of his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
His inarticulate prayer: "<i>Et ne nos indue as in
tentationem!</i>"  A wise one with reference to the
safety of his individual soul but hardly conducive
of expansive sympathy to others.
</p>

<p>
The horror he experienced in hearing this child,
a score of years younger than himself, approaching
for commonplace&mdash;as indeed they might be elsewhere
in the world, for all he cared&mdash;issues which,
until now, he had always succeeded in pushing far
from his own sphere of action, hindered him from
pressing her further.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
He might never have realized the immensities
at stake for her, but that Chance interfered to drive
his newly-acquired knowledge home.
</p>

<p>
At that moment Jardine was seen to be coming
across the lawn, a silver salver in his hand.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian aroused Ferlie in time.  When the old
butler stood before them, with the telegram, she was
presentably calm.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Minchin sent me out with it, your ladyship;
it was addressed to her.  His lordship wishes
her to inform you that he is arriving to-night and
would like one of the cars to meet the
8.15."  Mrs. Minchin was the housekeeper.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie took the yellow envelope from the tray and,
as she did so, Cyprian wondered whether it were
only in his imagination that a look passed between
mistress and man, electric with mutual warning.
</p>

<p>
Just the flash of an eyelid, and Jardine was
pursuing his majestic course over the grass, his
back-view impervious to criticism and comment.
Not until the last glimpse of his black coat-tails
had disappeared behind the yew-bushes did Ferlie
rise to her feet and face Cyprian beside the laughing
faun.  Again that illusory sightlessness filmed her
dilated pupils.  She looked through him and beyond
into a blank pall of darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian," the voice was dead like her face,
"Take me away."
</p>

<p>
He fancied the half-human leering thing of stone
stirred in evil exultation.  The twisted weather-beaten
features made an unholy contrast to those
others of still soft flesh on a level with them.
</p>

<p>
"I have nothing more to say to you than that,"
she said, when he did not answer.  "I will tell you
nothing more.  Whether you go with us or not, John
and I leave here to-night&mdash;in time.  You could not
trust me five years ago; can you trust me now?"
</p>

<p>
"It was not you five years ago; it was my own
creed that I could not trust."
</p>

<p>
"But now it is different, Cyprian.  You have
out-lived one stage of self-mistrust now."
</p>

<p>
Did man ever arrive beyond the reach of that
urging Power in a world peopled with mortal flesh,
he wondered.
</p>

<p>
Strange that, in forcing a decision upon himself
concerning Ferlie's future, Cyprian forgot the very
existence of Hla Byu and his son.  It was not his
intention to conceal from Ferlie the temporary loss
of will-power which had changed the tenour of his
life during the last two years.  But the Burmese
girl, received in a moment of sick physical weakness
and retained in pure apathy of soul, had existed
so mistily for the real Cyprian that, the practical
arrangements for her safe-keeping concluded, she
simply slipped out of the picture.  When he did
remember her she had become so superfluous among
the host of living memories he and Ferlie were
storing up that he could not bring himself to recall
her, even by speech.
</p>

<p>
"I know too thoroughly by what means the latent
forces of the body can accomplish the spirit's
murder"&mdash;she was speaking again and he recollected
himself&mdash;"But you and I have nothing to do with
such perishable links.  Nor do we require witnesses
to ratify a spiritual marriage for which we should
not have been prepared without these last enforced
years of disciplined control."
</p>

<p>
She stopped, confronted with his unyielding
silence, and, all at once, grew limp and human by
that other inhuman watcher in stone.  Her shoulders
relaxed, bowed and aged beneath their invisible
burden.
</p>

<p>
"I am not playing the part of Eve.  It is all
right.  I promised that you should never need to
ask me, a second time, to leave you.  I understand.
I am going now, alone."
</p>

<p>
He drew towards her then.
</p>

<p>
"You are going with me.  I am giving you no
choice.  Do you understand?  This decision is mine,
not yours.  You are going where I shall take you
and under whatsoever conditions I lay down, now,
and during your whole future.  The responsibility
is mine; you have got to put your trust in me."
</p>

<p>
Was it credible that the ripple of breeze through
the swaying stalks of a bed of tall Madonna lilies
drowned a satyr-laugh of derision?
</p>

<p>
Standing shoulder to shoulder they made no
attempt to touch one another's hands.
</p>

<p>
So might the Little Saint of Assisi have mythically
wedded Poverty, while Chastity and Obedience
supported her on either hand.
</p>

<p>
Said Ferlie, "I have nothing to give you that you
have not already.  Everything of yours has been
guarded safely behind a locked door.  And, Cyprian,
you have the key."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
To Miss Trefusis he outlined his scheme and found
her a little dubious.
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear man, this is the twentieth century.
Why not meet this fly-by-night lord and arrange
matters with modern sanity over a whisky and soda?"
</p>

<p>
"You are the only modern one of us three," he
reminded her, amusedly recognizing that her
unusually broad views, contact with which he had
once feared for Ferlie, were responsible for their
present re-union.  "Ferlie tells me that she has no
evidence for a divorce, nor can she seek it, in
consideration of the Church she has joined."
</p>

<p>
"Bless my soul!" exclaimed Aunt B., exasperated
that any Church should continue to consider joined
what she had been at such infinite pains to put
asunder.  "Surely you, Cyprian, are old enough to
smile at sects and Churches!  Ferlie would not be
true to type if, at her age, a cardinal did not seem
too picturesque to be a liar.  And, believe me, the
Pope was the only safe substitute for you."
</p>

<p>
"You, surely, are not advocating collusion?"
asked Cyprian, tickled, in spite of himself, at this
feminine Juggernaut, the wheels of whose common-sense
responded to no brake till she had guided them
triumphantly past her goal.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe there is 'no cause,'" she snapped:
"If he is a gentleman he will make one, since he has
obviously admitted her right to leave him.  It can't
affect the child's inheritance.  An atom of patience,
and the whole affair might be straightened out
with a minimum of scandal."
</p>

<p>
"There is no necessity for even a perfectly
respectable scandal," Cyprian assured her.  "Ferlie is
coming out to Burma with me, to live there as my
sister.  After a time, the man can get his marriage
annulled if he wishes, on the ground of desertion;
but that is unlikely to affect us."
</p>

<p>
Miss Trefusis searched his face with an expression
of mingled admiration and incredulity on her own.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am afraid you mean what I think you
mean," she said.  "You are more of a child than
she is, and I'd like to shake you.  I'd almost
rather you eloped healthily&mdash;without a new wedding-ring."
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry to disappoint you," Cyprian said.
</p>

<p>
She laid a hand on his arm which he immediately
imprisoned in his.
</p>

<p>
"Excelsior, then!  Go and freeze to death upon
your mountain top, both of you.  I have interfered
enough in bringing your bodily forms together.
I dare not dig inquisitive fingers into your souls."
</p>

<p>
It was arranged that her chauffeur should return
with them to the coast so as to render negligible the
chance of delay if any suspicion were aroused.
</p>

<p>
"But there is no earthly reason why Clifford
should want to argue it out with me," said Ferlie.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
At the last moment she gave way to a curious
attack of nerves, and again Cyprian suspected that
the incident was due to some secret reminder
conveyed to her by Jardine.
</p>

<p>
From the step of the limousine, into which the
sleeping John had been carried, she let go Cyprian's
arm and darted back up the steps.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt B.!  You will go home yourself to-night,
won't you?  Take the Daimler!"
</p>

<p>
"Hurry, child!  It is twenty minutes to eight.
Yes.  I am all ready to start, and you can trust me
to take care of myself."
</p>

<p>
"Come, Ferlie, don't waste any more time."
</p>

<p>
She ignored even that quiet voice, looking
uncertainly at Jardine who dropped his eyes with an
almost imperceptible movement of his head.
</p>

<p>
"You will see my aunt comfortably off, Jardine?"
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie, don't be foolish!  Since when have
I needed dry-nursing?  Make her get in, Cyprian.
There, darling!  There.  Shut the door.  That's
right, Cyprian.  Write to me, both of you.  What
is she shaking about?  I won't let Clifford eat me
in any case.  Good-bye.  Look after her, Cyprian.
Good-bye!  Good-bye!"
</p>

<p>
They were whirled out of her sight.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Whereupon, the temptation of Eve descended
upon Aunt B.
</p>

<p>
She had never met this husband of Ferlie's and,
on reconsidering that fact, it seemed that Ferlie
herself had always intervened in the past to prevent
a meeting.  There was really no need for her to
hurry home to-night; she might even serve the
fugitives best by staying to produce some plausible
reason for Ferlie's sudden "journey to town."
</p>

<p>
Jardine, to her amazement, was respectfully
inhospitable in his opposition to this proposed
change of plan.  He made it unmistakably clear that
he wished to be rid of her.  And the more insistently
he conveyed that impression, the more obstinately
did Miss Trefusis desire to see the owner of Black
Towers.
</p>

<p>
To settle the matter out of hand she went to her
room, unpacked a dinner dress of silver-grey velvet,
and came downstairs wearing it and an assured air
which discouraged argument.
</p>

<p>
Said Jardine to her in the hall where he was
hovering like a distressed bat among the
chain-mailed ancestors.
</p>

<p>
"It is to be expected that his lordship will
dine in his own apartments, Madam.  I have not
put off the dinner hour to suit his late arrival."
</p>

<p>
Therefore, at 8.15 precisely, Aunt B. found herself
frustrated thus far, at the end of the long table.
</p>

<p>
Half-way through the meal came the sounds of
arrival: the footman's hurrying steps and a man's
voice in the hall.
</p>

<p>
She strained her ears, but silence soon followed
the retreating feet and then Jardine came in to ask
if she would have coffee on the terrace.
</p>

<p>
"Too chilly," was her cross verdict, and he agreed
that the little drawing-room and a fire would be
more comfortable.
</p>

<p>
Even after she had drunk the coffee and was
immersed in the newspaper, she remained aware of
the old servant's flitting presence.  He appeared
to be finding matters to occupy him in the small
drawing-room and only after she had twice looked
up inquiringly over the printed page did he make
reluctantly for the door.
</p>

<p>
She sat on when the paper, restlessly devoured,
had slipped from her knees to the floor.  Soft radiance
glowed about her through orange silk shades,
etherealizing the dignified feminine figure with its
close-fitting crown of silvery hair.  The features,
in repose not unlike Ferlie's, were attractively
gentle.  She leant back in the dark tapestried chair
and thought of the lovers, of the long trail which
lay before them, of the spiritual courage supporting
their rare decision.  Could a man and a woman
live under such conditions, loving as these two
loved?
</p>

<p>
And something told her that it was just because
they so loved that the improbable became possible.
</p>

<p>
If they failed that Utopian ideal in the end&mdash;  She
broke off her reflections with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Who is to judge?" she asked aloud of the
flames on the open hearth.  "Who is to judge These,
or Any?"
</p>

<p>
A man on the terrace, rolling a cigarette with
uncertain fingers, heard the quiet question and
paused in his occupation.  His eyes glittered oddly
over the flickering match, just struck, and the face,
as he lifted it starwards, was not unlike the face of
the deriding faun, aged by the battering years into
a very surely alive satyr.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Cold, suffocating darkness in the hall, and the
comforting impassive bulk of old Jardine.
</p>

<p>
Later, a square of corpse-coloured light, and the
black marble steps making a row of ebony mirrors
for the waning moon.  Beyond them, the blurred
lines of Ferlie's Daimler, heralding escape to the
dainty simplicity of the lavender-scented garden and
rooms sweet with the pot-pourri of clean sane
memories.
</p>

<p>
Finding her voice, she turned fiercely upon the
man supporting her trembling descent.
</p>

<p>
"And you knew&mdash;and remained silent, while
she was facing That!"
</p>

<p>
His slow gesture was controlled but unyielding.
</p>

<p>
"For forty years, Madam, I have served the
Greville-Mainwarings.  As their like dies out so
does my like die out which has learnt the lesson of
silence."
</p>

<p>
He closed the door of the car upon her, adding
with cold dignity,
</p>

<p>
"Her ladyship chose to become a Greville-Mainwaring."
</p>

CHAPTER XII
</h3>

<p>
"Do you know what I think, Cyprian?" asked
John, lost in admiration for the ingenuity which
had lined the channel leading from his sand-castle
with practically watertight slates and stones,
"I think you've got a Brain."
</p>

<p>
"So that's what your mother tells Miss Trefusis
of you," deduced Cyprian.  "By the way, I have
an uneasy suspicion that she intended you to address
me as 'Uncle.'"
</p>

<p>
"What for?"
</p>

<p>
"As a mark of well-deserved respect, I fancy,
and in token of my thinning locks."
</p>

<p>
"You don't look like 'uncle.'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know.  Considering I had reached
a man's estate when your mother was not much
higher than you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Did Mother call you 'Uncle' then?"
</p>

<p>
"Just you ask her if not why not," advised Cyprian.
</p>

<p>
John mused awhile.
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow, I won't," he decided.
</p>

<p>
"Won't ask her?"
</p>

<p>
"Will call you by your real name."
</p>

<p>
"That's what she said," Cyprian admitted.  "But,
as man to man, John, I must warn you that she
will probably have the last word in the matter, even
if it is an inconsistent one.  I have known her longer
than you have."
</p>

<p>
"But I have known her most," returned John in
some agitation.  "She was <i>my</i> mother first."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian took warning.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, yes.  She would be the first to
admit it.  Go your rebel way, then, and get the
better of the woman.  <i>I</i> shan't interfere.  I have
my own troubles."
</p>

<p>
The conversation took place on a sunny portion
of the Brittany coast where Ferlie had, for some
weeks, been trustfully waiting for John and Cyprian
to decide that they liked one another.  Neither of
them possessing gaily expansive natures the discovery
took time.
</p>

<p>
A neutrality pact had been sealed earlier on this
particular afternoon when Cyprian, armed with an
offering of peppermint rock, having fallen unawares
into the well of sea-water outside John's castle, had
aroused in himself a throng of dimly ecstatic
recollections and intimations of the Immortality of
Childhood, as the poet simply puts it, and so flung
himself whole-heartedly into the business of
constructing an aqueduct, a smouldering ambition of
his childhood, ever frustrated by the inopportune
interference of the old and wise....
</p>

<p>
"You," said John presently, touched by his
conscientious absorption, "may have the 'nother
stick of peppermint rock when you've done."
</p>

<p>
"If it's to save your life I will accept it but I
feel it only honest to confess that I am not allowed
to eat sweets between meals."
</p>

<p>
"Neither am I when Mother comes out with
us....  I want Mother."
</p>

<p>
"So do I want her.  But I am man enough to put
the aqueduct before the yearnings of my softer
nature."
</p>

<p>
"Well, but you don't want to be sick."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian dropped the spade to look at him.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth are we going to do about it?"
he asked at length.  John showed him.
</p>

<p>
"And now," said Cyprian bitterly, "as, prompted
by a kind and noble heart, I bought you the beastly
stuff, I suppose she'll blame me!"
</p>

<p>
"I won't tell," John assured him faintly.  And
didn't.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Almost immediately after this incident sealing
his position in John's world, Cyprian received news
of his Company's affiliation to a branch of mines
in another district, and of his own transfer to a
station more or less populated.
</p>

<p>
It meant a fresher beginning for himself and
Ferlie in Burma than if he had remained under the
eye of old acquaintances.  He would be now,
practically, in a managing position with much sedentary
office-work in head-quarters and only a limited amount
of inspecting.
</p>

<p>
But Ferlie and he would find it difficult to isolate
themselves from their neighbours, even if Cyprian's
reputation as a recluse preceded him and Ferlie's
advertised one as a widow.
</p>

<p>
Fortunate for her now that the Burma Season
had never materialized before her father's enforced
retirement; for, though Burma is not the size of
a London suburb, news there travels in more
persistent circles.
</p>

<p>
As things were, the few remaining officials who
had known her father well enough to remember
he had a daughter would hardly connect the knowledge
with the advent of "Mrs. Clifford" to keep
house for a brother, up-country, who was not a
Member of the Services.  Cyprian felt that the
change might result in a more normal and wholesome
life for Ferlie, at her age, than he could
originally have offered her, and she owned to
rejoicing in the prospect of medical aid should
John get ill.
</p>

<p>
The first time she saw their bungalow of dark
crimson wood, with its shingled roof and white
painted verandah, the porch trembled beneath the
red tubes of blossoming kuskwalis, the subtle velvet
scent of which mingled with the thick creamy
sweetness pouring from the waxen stars of two
leafless frangipani trees in the garden.
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian, how beautiful!" as the loose crowns
showered over her with every gust of breeze.  "I
wonder why there is something sorrowful in the
message their scent holds for me."
</p>

<p>
But he remembered that the lilies sentinelling
the church for Ferlie's wedding had been numerous
enough to saturate the air with a similar
sickly-sweet fragrance.
</p>

<p>
Since they were seeking forgetfulness in these
surroundings he said nothing.
</p>

<p>
The radiance of their life together during the
next few months was an amazement to his
unintrospective soul.
</p>

<p>
He had sometimes wondered on what foundation
rested Ferlie's invincible faith that, in this purely
spiritual companionship, they would not be tempted
beyond their strength to trample the Code.
</p>

<p>
He did not know that, since John's birth and her
husband's development in a direction which made
normal married life with him impossible, Ferlie,
with her passion for complete understanding
unclouded by merciful ignorance, had delved into strange
formidably-backed volumes in her efforts to tear
out by the roots the tragedy which had shattered
her innocence.  She had shrunk at first towards
asceticism as an answer to the racking question
"What shall we do to be saved?"&mdash;from Self;
a mankind weak and bewildered but sub-conscious,
nevertheless, of an attainable state of grace
synonymous with Immortality.
</p>

<p>
But, with Cyprian dwelling still in her heart,
and refusing to be ejected even during this complete
reaction, she had been forced to seek a more modified
code than that of the professed nun.
</p>

<p>
Quite by chance, she discovered it in Chrysostom's
outcry against the anti-pagan, but, as he considered
it, also the anti-Christian, custom, which had become
known among some of his contemporary ascetics;
who lived at the side of virgins in uplifting and
intimate companionship, the chastity of which was
never called in question.  More than one Father of
the Church, cast in sterner mould, had felt it his
duty to reprove and deplore this method of cheating
the devil.  Among them, and the fact had caused
Ferlie some amusement, leavened with a queer
aching, there was Cyprian's own namesake insistent
on the "weakness" of her sex and the "wanton"
tendencies of youth.
</p>

<p>
But it was significant that even Chrysostom
acknowledged that in such seemingly unnatural
friendships there was room for a love deeper and
more lasting than any found in the fulfilment of
legitimate bodily passion.
</p>

<p>
Upon such an admission Ferlie had built her
temple to Love, and in the lonely turret at Black
Towers learnt something of the power of
concentrated thought.
</p>

<p>
Of her studies Cyprian remained unaware.
</p>

<p>
Sex-psychology had never obsessed him as it
has so many modern minds.  He knew that Tolstoy,
for whom he retained a very real admiration, had
developed into a married ascetic, but had been
inclined to smile at the humour presented in the
situation of a man, married and with his own quiver
quite literally full, advocating a higher life, rooted
in celibacy, to his fellows.
</p>

<p>
The apple eaten, where the merit of flinging away
the core and informing the world that the fruit was
sour?
</p>

<p>
But for that abnormally sensitive streak in him,
which forced him to respond to the suggestion of
an idealistic love as naturally as the sunflower to
the sun, Cyprian might have degenerated into the
egotistical scholar, thick-visioned as to the needs
of Humanity, and justly derided by ribald
undergraduates as "the product of a long line of maiden
aunts."
</p>

<p>
This, supposing Muriel Vane had not wounded
him in time and sent him fleeing into the desert to
hide his hurt.
</p>

<p>
The same streak, unsatisfied and hungry, had
enabled him to close his eyes, temporarily, to the
tenets of the rigid creed natural to this type, when
Hla Byu smiled up at him in the pitiless sunlight;
the same streak, legacy perhaps of some long-dead
Tristrannic ancestor&mdash;hardening at the sight of
Ferlie's suffering, had inspired the courage preparing
him to set at defiance every other normally narrow
instinct of his senses which shrank from the
abnormal, and had led him to accept a position at her
side, for which, once, more bitterly than the severe
Cyprian of bygone centuries, he would have
condemned a fellow-man.
</p>

<p>
The fact remained that he and Ferlie, and Ferlie's
son by the rival he had every reason to consider
better dead, had entered into a kingdom so glad
with light and deep with peace; its ways so rich
with psychological exploration; its gates so
strengthened with spiritual discipline, that they
became nearly oblivious to the world of
non-mystics, who would neither have understood these
strangers in their midst, nor have desired to
understand.
</p>

<p>
And the eye of the materialist is critical and his
tongue, unsheathed, a two-edged sword.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The first intimation either of them had that
other mortal inhabitants of the earth were interested
in them, as fellow-pilgrims to the goal of pensioned
and idle security, occurred after a period of nearly
six months, when Sterne's good-looking little
widowed sister might reasonably be expected to
have started advertising her weeds in the exchange
and barter column of the <i>Pioneer</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Weeds?  My dear fellow, she's never worn
'em.  Flits about 'clothed in white'&mdash;what-do-you-call-it
'mystic, wonderful,' and flaunts a promising
scarlet head."
</p>

<p>
"Scarlet, did you say?  You're colour-blind.
I've only seen her from the road, myself, but she'd
rank as a 'Beaut' with that hair if she had a face
like a mince-pie."
</p>

<p>
"Fancy old Diogenes possessing a sister like that!
I was with him at G. and he never mentioned her."
</p>

<p>
"Must be a 'half.'  She's twenty years younger
at least.  What's the name?"
</p>

<p>
"She's a Mrs. Clifford."
</p>

<p>
This conversation took place in a long low
building, flanked by a hard tennis court and dignified
by the title, "Club."  The speakers were congregated
at a kind of counter commonly known as
the "Bar."  Cyprian did not frequent it and Ferlie
was still postponing her public appearance.
</p>

<p>
The wives had found her difficult of access during
the customary calling hours, and mildly resented a
reticence which might almost be described as
unfriendly.
</p>

<p>
John mingled with the other children in the
so-called "Gardens" of the Station, at first entirely
as an onlooker, in charge of the impassive Burmese
servant, but, later, in the capacity of a leader, of
few words and indomitable energy.
</p>

<p>
John, at Black Towers, during those short years
of his life when his mother, like Cyprian, was
hiding from an Argus-eyed Society, had existed as
a dreamer of dreams and an inventor of games
peopled by imaginary companions.  It was not long
before the notion struck him to cast the youth of
the Station for the various roles hitherto filled by
bolsters, chain-armour and stuffed animals.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie noted with satisfaction that he fitted his
own niche in Cyprian's heart, and, while remonstrating,
she was secretly entertained when Cyprian
discoursed with him in the terms of an equal.
</p>

<p>
"He simply inspires me with multi-syllabic
expressions," pleaded Cyprian, "I think it is his
insuperable gravity."
</p>

<p>
At that she sighed a little.
</p>

<p>
"One would imagine he had already learnt that,
though we may make a game of Life, Life is often
more successful in making game of us."
</p>

<p>
To which he answered, "Nonsense," adding,
most inexcusably, the over-worked saw, "I am the
Master of my Fate; I am the Captain of my
Soul."
</p>

<p>
"I am delighted to hear you say so," Ferlie told
him, "I can remember a time when your soul
captained you pretty thoroughly, though, pagan
that you are, you could hardly own to such
domination."
</p>

<p>
She sometimes reflected upon that self-sufficiency
which induced him to dismiss the Churches as
unreliable excrescences upon a useful ethical
foundation.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian was, undoubtedly, one of the characters
which cling passionately to the Christian
Commandments and let the Christ pass by.
</p>

<p>
"The woman Thou gavest me," accused Adam,
meanly ungrateful, and, "The Brain Thou gavest
me," blamed Cyprian and all his calibre.
</p>

<p>
Man's mentality, thought Ferlie, had not altered
much since Eden, though he did not, now, make
the Woman the sole excuse for his shortcomings,
being obliged to admit that she was more often an
inspiration than an obstruction to Faith.  But there
were other gifts for whose shoddiness and lack of
wearing-power he could still taunt their Giver, and
among them ranked that Brain which was incapable
of surrendering to belief in One who could so
love the world.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie, her own conscience still at rest with that
Great Lover, simply because of her trust in a love
which, knowing all, forgives, had never attempted to
probe the blank agnosticism to which Cyprian
speechlessly held.  She was sensible of the admiration
due to an intellect which, in the face of such
pessimism, could stand for Right merely for Right's
sake.  He had no guide but an instinctive sense of
duty and when that failed him he looked to her love.
Only hers in all the world, remembered Ferlie,
exultantly hugging the realization of his aloofness
to her heart.
</p>

<p>
And then.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Mother," said John, "there are a nice little
nigger-boy in the verandah, and a grown-up nigger-girl,
too.  And she's crying," he added as an afterthought.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie, suspicious of the diseases John might
contract from mendicants on the steps of the
picturesque but unclean pagodas had, nevertheless,
acquired a well-merited reputation for filling the
hungry with good things.  To John, who knew by
heart the exciting nursery epic dealing with a dusky
youthful band, whose ranks dwindled in the course
of their unforeseen adventures, from ten to one
("So he got married and then there were none!")
all members of the Eastern races were descendants
of that fortunate survivor.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't touch the little boy, John darling,"
asked Ferlie with misgiving.
</p>

<p>
She recalled the burnt-out lepers which crouched
at the gilded god's feet, unmolested in sun-soaked
apathy.
</p>

<p>
"They're very clean niggers," evaded John,
"And they don't want you; it's Cyprian."
</p>

<p>
Now Cyprian did not suffer gladly these invasions
of his premises by the lame, the halt and the blind.
</p>

<p>
He had more than once given Ferlie to understand
that, in his opinion, charity to the guileless
Burman should begin anywhere but at home.
Therefore, it struck her that the couple announced
by John would, in all likelihood, be connected with
the labourers in the mines.  Perhaps a dismissed
washer whose wife and child had come to effect his
reconciliation with Authority.
</p>

<p>
She found Hla Byu shrinking in the shadow of
the riotous creepers, and smiled upon her.
</p>

<p>
Then turned particular attention to John's "nice
little nigger."  The first glimpse showed her that he
was remarkably fair even for a young high-class
Burman child, but after a closer inspection a
bewildered and then an inscrutable expression came
over her face.  She looked from the child back to
the tear-stained and apologetic mother.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie did not yet know much Burmese.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" she inquired haltingly.
</p>

<p>
The woman replied in clipped English.
</p>

<p>
"I come to see the Thakin."
</p>

<p>
The child screwed up his eyes in a way wholly
familiar.  They were exceeding blue: Cyprian's
eyes in a small cream-coloured face.
</p>

<p>
John, regarding him with unbated interest,
reiterated,
</p>

<p>
"Aren't he a nice little nigger?"
</p>

<p>
It seemed a very long while to Ferlie before
Cyprian came home.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
As luck would have it, he had undertaken to
meet a business acquaintance at the Club,
demi-officially, to discuss the contract for some new
machinery.  They concluded the conversation in the
now nearly empty bar-room, since it had been
prolonged late and club-members were drifting
home.
</p>

<p>
One man lingered; a breezy loud-voiced individual
from Cyprian's former district, to whom Life was
one long smoking-room yarn.  Forrester had shown
himself rather perturbed when the news leaked out
that Sterne, on departing for his Leave, had provided
for his Burmese "keep."  Creating these Quixotic
precedents!  All very well for a blooming bachelor
of his amiably inexpensive habits, but how in hell
was a man with a missus and kids in England to
pension off every little bit of yellow fluff that drifted
his way?
</p>

<p>
Therefore, he was delighted, on this particular
evening to run across Sterne in the one place where
he could refer to the matters pertaining to men in
general.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Sterne!" he roared joyously.  "Have
one with me.  You'll need it.  Saw your latest
<i>lune-de-mielle</i> toiling up the long, long trail just
now in search of your bungalow.  She wasn't alone,
neither.  It's a good-looking kid, I must say.  But
isn't Mrs. Clifford going to sit up and take notice?
You shouldn't have such characteristic eyes, man."
</p>

<p>
"Did you say you'd have a drink?" asked
Cyprian jerkily.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, it's my shout.  And it's no use your
trying to change the conversation.  Homer has
nodded and we all know about it.  Where you slipped
up was in letting your past know your present
address."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian saw the thing through, his brain working
busily.  He had been a fool not to gauge the
possibility of Hla Byu's reappearance, considering the
terms on which they had parted.  And he could
not excuse himself for having omitted to tell Ferlie.
He supposed that his reluctance to do so sprang
from the fact that, since their long acquaintance
dated from her childhood, it was difficult for him to
accept her even now as altogether a woman and,
moreover, a woman who had touched pitch without
being defiled.
</p>

<p>
He climbed the hill in the dusk, his face troubled,
trying to decide how far Hla Byu would have
succeeded in making herself understood.  Unfortunately,
his own memory convinced him that little
Thu Daw's eyes would not take very much understanding
of either Ferlie's instinct or her intelligence.
</p>

<p>
He had not the remotest idea what he was going
to say to satisfy her of the strange truth that his very
heart-hunger for her was responsible for Thu Daw.
</p>

<p>
Once more the word leapt out as if written in
letters of flame across the blackening hill-side.  No
explanation could make him anything but "responsible"
for his son, as surely as Ferlie was for hers.
</p>

<p>
He swung back the garden-gate and clashed it
behind him, thereupon hastening his footsteps,
urged by a nauseating desire to get this scene
with Ferlie over.
</p>

<p>
And saw her in the grey gloom, coming to meet
him between the two long borders of flaming lilies
with his child in her arms.
</p>

<p>
When she reached him it was to lift a face glorified
with the forgiveness he had not asked.
</p>

<p>
"My very dear," she said, "Why did you not tell me?"
</p>

<p>
Even thus far could Ferlie trust her earthly god.

CHAPTER XIII
</h3>

<p>
So Cyprian did very little explaining.
</p>

<p>
Hla Byu settled down like a shadow over their
existence in one of the rooms, awaiting suggestions,
and for some time none were forthcoming.
</p>

<p>
John welcomed the addition of Thu Daw to the
household, but he was the only person to whom
the addition was not fraught with strain.
</p>

<p>
Neither Cyprian nor Ferlie knew quite how to
handle the question of Thu Daw's eyes and the
message they carried.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian was broodingly silent during those days
and looked tired.  Till, at last, Ferlie stole into his
office, balanced herself on the edge of the writing-table
and sat there swinging abstracted legs.
</p>

<p>
He gave her time; only laying down his pen
and sitting back in his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," she said presently, "I am being
rather careless in my handling of high explosives.
Women and gunpowder can seldom come to a
perfect understanding."
</p>

<p>
"Which being interpreted is&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"That I have no right to force my opinions upon
anyone so much older than myself as you are&mdash;and
I do realize that a woman cannot feel with a
man."
</p>

<p>
"I know one who seems to," Cyprian told her
gently.
</p>

<p>
Her mouth smiled gratefully at that but she
kept her head bent over the tangling fingers in her
lap.
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian.  One should not try to run before one
can walk.  In some ways I am stupidly ignorant
about practical facts....  Is this life too great a
strain on you?"
</p>

<p>
Then, as he hesitated, while searching for her
exact meaning, she went on in a swift rush of
breathlessness.
</p>

<p>
"Let me get it out&mdash;somehow....  Man cannot
help his dual nature.  Women mostly can.  If you
have found Her helpful&mdash;I know you are without
the mystical help religion brings in its wake&mdash;when
my absence was more than you could bear, I would
be willing to subordinate my prejudices on this
gigantic question, to your common-sense, and let
her help again should there be times when my
presence may be more than you can bear.  After
all, she is the&mdash;mother of your son."
</p>

<p>
The last sentence was whispered and she did not
move as his chair creaked.
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie!"  For the first time in their lives there
was a very real anger in the eyes which, unflinching
now, captured hers and held them steady.  His
lips closed in a thin line and for a full minute she
watched him, almost fearfully, as he framed his
reply.
</p>

<p>
"How dare you?" he asked at long last.  "How
dare you?"
</p>

<p>
He got up and walked to the open door, to stand
in it with his back to her, looking up and down
the verandah.  The act was instinctive since they
were always alone, but he drew the glass panels
together with a quick snapping of the latch before
turning to face her again.
</p>

<p>
"You can only be a child, indeed, to come
cold-bloodedly to any man with such an insult in
your mind; most of all to the man you profess to
respect."
</p>

<p>
"Respect!  Oh, Cyprian&mdash;&mdash;"  But he could not
spare her anything just then.  He was too cruelly
wounded.
</p>

<p>
"How can you&mdash;how can I believe that you have
the smallest respect for me when I see myself, through
this indefensible proposal of yours, as you must
see me?  Cannot you understand that what
constituted a drug to deaden the physical suffering&mdash;I
repeat the word, for that mental pain was physical
to me caused by your withdrawal and your silence
in a life which had been unconsciously centred in
you for nearly eleven years&mdash;must affect me like a
corroding poison, even in retrospect, now that
sanity and mental control have returned with your
presence?"
</p>

<p>
She stirred restlessly, struck with the justification
for this point of view.
</p>

<p>
"Then, there is the moral aspect.  Sometimes,
I think that you, despite your genuine religious
mysticism, are absolutely unmoral in your normal
outlook.  One can condone wrong too far.  Your
very compassion for that which right-minded people
should shun becomes, of its injurious weakness, a sin.
But&mdash;Good God!&mdash;who am I to talk to you of sin.
I have not denied that you are infinitely above me,
but I did not grasp you considered the gulf between
us quite so wide as this morning you have made
it out to be."
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian!"
</p>

<p>
The anguish in her voice roused him to some
realization as to how far he had lost his temper.
Still dazed with the shock she had afforded him, he
saw her crumple up like a victim of lightning
herself, across the solid writing-desk.
</p>

<p>
He went to her then and gathered her against
his angrily-beating heart.
</p>

<p>
Strange that neither of them wondered what lay
hidden in the heart of Hla Byu.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie, whenever she met her about the house,
would smile kindly in place of the conversation
which was impossible, and Thu Daw's picturesque
little mother invariably smiled back, but her slanting
brows lent enigma to this acknowledgment of the
white woman's recognition.
</p>

<p>
She had been told that her Thakin, on whose
generous supplies she had patiently lived apart,
had returned across the great water, bringing with
him a sister.  But this was no sister, determined
Hla Byu.  Once, also, in careless answer to discreet
questioning, the Thakin had informed her that he
was alone in the world; except for herself, she had
understood.
</p>

<p>
She came of a race to which love is the be-all
and end-all of its women-folk's existence.  The
Impassive Teacher had not succeeded in releasing
them from its bondage.  For this reason must a
Burmese woman be re-born as a man before she
can attain Nirvana.
</p>

<p>
Hla Byu, once established by Cyprian in his
house, finally ceased to worry about any Nirvana
that did not include him.  Naturally quick and full
of initiative, she gleaned something from the orderly
regulation of his days and more from close association
with the class-refinement of his habits.  He was
truly one of the greater Thakins and not one of
that set which dines in the costume it also uses for
sleeping; though, doubtless, it seemed sensible to
choose one's coolest garments for the exertion of
eating, thought Hla Byu, in those past days when
she had been able to compare notes with other
women in her position.
</p>

<p>
And, now, she was eminently suited for the post
to which Ferlie relegated her: that of nurse-companion
to John and Thu Daw.  There was little enough for
her to do but to superintend the games of her son
with the Thakin's acknowledged nephew and to
watch Thu Daw's latent intelligence developing
daily along the lines of a European child's.
</p>

<p>
Yet, as the weeks slipped by, she did not appear
to find them happy and the unguessed-at resentment,
veiled under her submissive demeanour, was
smouldering into a gnawing flame which hurt while
it burnt.  To Cyprian she had become more than
a stranger, being of less account in his life than a
table or chair.
</p>

<p>
The star-flowers she gathered to wear drew
appreciative comments from Ferlie, which, oddly
enough, angered her so that she ceased entirely from
thus decorating the polished ebony of her hair.
She had brought with her new lungis of soft gay
silk, rejoicing in them as his gifts, but she might
have gone in rags for all he remarked of her
daintiness and charm.  Not so immune does a man become
on account of a sister's presence.
</p>

<p>
Even Thu Daw failed to sweeten the bitterness
of her cup of humiliation.  He would stretch out
welcoming arms to Ferlie now for her to carry him
away to look at pictures with John, and his Burmese
mother began to feel alienated from the foreign
blood in his veins.  A child was of his father's
nationality.
</p>

<p>
No one read her soul nor conceived the approach
of the ultimate crisis.
</p>

<p>
One night Ferlie heard Cyprian call to her from
the room he occupied at the far end of the long
verandah.  She had not begun to undress and hurried
along to him immediately, carrying a hurricane
lantern since scorpions sometimes lay out on the
cool stone after dark.
</p>

<p>
He stood in the doorway, his face queerly expressive.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to look at this."
</p>

<p>
In the pale-lemon flame of an oil reading-lamp,
the room showed shadow-streaked, but the air was
saturated with the sweet heavy scent of some
freshly-plucked flower.
</p>

<p>
He took the lantern from her hand and lifted it
high, flinging its rays across the bed.
</p>

<p>
His pillow and counterpane were invisible for a
mass of starry blooms whose warm sweetness petalled
this prepared fairy couch.  Ferlie caught her breath,
uncertain whether she most wanted to laugh or to
cry.  True to her immortal tendency to snatch beauty
from every corner of the world, however close it
lurked, she said swiftly, "Cyprian, it's pretty!
It's so <i>pretty</i>.  Look just at the prettiness of it.
But oh ... if only it had not been ... inevitable!"
</p>

<p>
He answered, simply enough, without facing her,
</p>

<p>
"I guessed you'd say that.  I never dreamed of
this.  I never do seem to foresee things.  But,
however you look at it, she must go."
</p>

<p>
It was not then that they discovered she had already
gone.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
She was taken out of the river very early in the
morning when a silver film of dew veiled the rushes
and new buds were blossoming to life upon the
soaking trees.  Flame-of-the-forest reared its
scorching beauty above her when they laid her limp upon
the shore; her bright draperies draggled, and the
once shining coil of her hair hanging in a tangled
shroud over her breast.
</p>

<p>
And so Cyprian saw her when summoned to
identify her as his "servant."  Well and truly had
she served a Master more crushingly exacting than he.
</p>

<p>
In the haunted days&mdash;and nights&mdash;which followed
for him, Cyprian felt that, but for Ferlie's gentle
patience and sense of vision, he might easily have
lost his reason.
</p>

<p>
At first he was merely stunned.  Later, when he
thawed to understanding of the part his own
impotent hand had taken in directing the tragedy,
he spoke of himself as a murderer.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie stepped in and sternly banished the word.
</p>

<p>
"It is pure hysteria that makes you use it," she
told him.  "I blame myself more than you, for I am
a woman and should have been enough in sympathy
with another women's mind to have prevented this.
If you are a murderer then I am a murderess."
</p>

<p>
He railed at her foolishness but sped off on
another track.
</p>

<p>
"Why should this have happened to me?" in
bewildered anger.  "No other man of my acquaintance
has ever had to face such an experience, and
I have done no more than what so many do.  In
this custom there is no disgrace to the woman.
She usually settles down, in the end, with one of
her own race.  I&mdash;Ferlie, believe me&mdash;I tried to
play the game.  She need never have done it.  I tell
you there was no disgrace."
</p>

<p>
"There was something else though," she reminded
him, "and that left her little choice.  It is as I said,
Cyprian; no one seems able to escape its scourge."
</p>

<p>
"But they don't love like that," he persisted.
"How can they?  There is no link but that frail
fleshly one of which a man remains vaguely ashamed
the whole time."
</p>

<p>
"There is that link," and she pointed to Thu
Daw, perilously employed with a coloured wooden
mallet and a rusty nail.
</p>

<p>
She moved across the room to take it away from
him and, substituting a woollen ball, returned to
lay her arm lightly about Cyprian's bowed shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"There has been enough in the past," he said.
"Why should Fate have picked me out for this
extra bruising?"
</p>

<p>
Thought Ferlie of the declaration that whom the
gods love they chasten.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, Cyprian, because you are so worth
while to try and teach things to."
</p>

<p>
But this was cold and cryptic comfort and she
knew it.
</p>

<p>
In the night she heard him restlessly passing
from room to room till, finally, his footsteps paused
on the verandah.  She slipped a wrap about her
shoulders and went to him where he leant against
the open trellis-work of the porch, astir with shivering
leaves.
</p>

<p>
His face, clear-cut against a sheet of trembling
moonlight, was drawn and ghastly, and when she
touched his arm his whole body started violently.
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian," said Ferlie sharply, "Can't you take
your medicine like a man?"
</p>

<p>
The taunt stung him to an effort of self-control.
</p>

<p>
"It's that damned frangipani," he told her
apologetically, "And it is part of Burma&mdash;and so
of my life henceforth&mdash;eternally."
</p>

<p>
She slipped a hand in his and drew him down the
garden-walk till they stood beneath the trees, stiff
with their own sweetness.
</p>

<p>
"You have got to face that scent, here and now.
You have got to think of it for what it is: a rich
passionate fragrance embodying all that was
generous and brave and joyous in the spirit of Hla
Byu.  That is what she would have wished, Cyprian.
<i>That is what she is wishing now.</i>"
</p>

<p>
The velvet glory of the night was musical with
faint sound and every flower and shrub raised a
deified shadow to the searching purity of the
inscrutable stars.  Now and again a delicate moth rippled
by, like the ghost of some dead blossom, on an
unknown quest into the Unknown.
</p>

<p>
"And there, God rest her soul!" said Ferlie,
presently.
</p>

<p>
The man at her side felt the Amen he could not
bring himself to utter.
</p>

<p>
What he did reply was, "My dear, I love you.
It's all right now because of that....  It will be
all right."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
At the Club a few days later...
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear that Mrs. Clifford has adopted
her brother's Indiscretion?"
</p>

<p>
"Lord! ... Wonder what he told her?"
</p>

<p>
"Maybe, that the lady represented the mourning
and destitute widow of some mining accident."
</p>

<p>
"Mourning and destitute widow of your grandfather!
Haven't you seen the kid?"
</p>

<p>
"I have.  Never imagined anything so uncanny.
The eyes, you know.  Same old delphinium blue&mdash;but
that might be explained away as a freak of
Nature.  Not much the identical trick of screwing
'em up and blinking at you!  That's what betrays
the whereabouts of Pussy."
</p>

<p>
"I don't care what he's told her.  She's been
married and is certainly no fool.  She must be a
good sort."
</p>

<p>
And, in that capacity, Ferlie found herself
welcomed by the male population of the station when
she, perforcedly, began to drift in and out of social
gatherings.  She was inclined to regret the precious
hours thus wasted outside the borders of their
Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
"We have so much past unhappiness to overtake,
as yet, Cyprian."
</p>

<p>
But a whole year had slipped by and he decided
that it was wiser that she should make friends with
people now that she had no longer any excuse for
isolation.
</p>

<p>
She had received a curious epistle from Clifford,
through Aunt Brillianna, to whom he had sent it
under the impression that Ferlie was occupying
some Villa of hers in Italy.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you will agree," he wrote, "that I have,
at least, proved myself no dog-in-the-manger.  The
only thing which might make it necessary for me
to worry you with divorce proceedings would be if
anything happened to John.
</p>

<p>
"You see, granted that you are right in considering
the Greville-Mainwarings a decadent lot, it remains
my job to carry on the line somehow, and the heirs
would have to be legitimate.  I am not actually
apologizing for any lurid behaviour (as you might
describe it) of the last four years, but I have notions
of fair play and we are not living in the reign of
the lady who wept to wear a crown.  I might have
more reason to weep if she were wearing it now.
</p>

<p>
"Mercifully, matrimony is not, these days, the
shackled and testamentary thing it was reckoned
to be before the Jews originally lost Jerusalem.
If ever you outgrow your mysterious ideas and want
to marry again, let me know and I'll see what
I can do for you.  For myself, I am content with
the present position so long as there is John to
carry on the title some time or other.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you well, Ferlie, and, if it comforts you,
I do not think it would do any harm if you
occasionally prayed for my unregenerate soul."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie laid this sheet before Cyprian, without
comment.
</p>

<p>
"Swine," was his exact expression.
</p>

<p>
"Do you really feel like that, or is it only pose?"
</p>

<p>
"Pose?  How do you suppose any average man
would feel?"
</p>

<p>
"You're not the average man."
</p>

<p>
At the moment neither was his face good to look
upon.  She removed the letter and deserted the
subject.  And prayed quite a lot more for Clifford's
weakened soul.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the next Cold Weather her
mother died.
</p>

<p>
"We had drifted apart since my marriage," she
told Cyprian, remorsefully tearful, "But, at the
end of the first year, when I realized that things were
hopeless and that Clifford and I must separate,
I could not conquer the feeling that she should have
been capable of protecting me instead of selling
me to a title that had existed too long.  After all,
I was so very young to throw in my lot with any
man."
</p>

<p>
"I got no thanks for trying to protect you from
this one," said Cyprian.
</p>

<p>
She smiled up at him with wet lashes.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Mother!  I see now that she thought she
was doing her utmost for me."
</p>

<p>
Soon after, a happier species of news came from
Peter.
</p>

<p>
Peter had qualified smartly and accepted a hard-worked
job in a mental institution, which had offered
him scant opportunity for leisurely experiment and
involved very considerable strain on nerves already
somewhat stretched by exams.
</p>

<p>
That old friend of the Carmichaels, Colonel
Maddock, had now made him the unique offer of a
free trip on his yacht which, he declared, had, like
himself, entered on a very new lease of life.  He was
determined as a "Last Kick" to sail it again in
Eastern waters, and required the attendance of a
qualified medical man on this somewhat, at his age,
hazardous undertaking.  Peter, he pointed out,
would be none the worse for a sea-trip, combining
business with pleasure, and he would be able to
find time for a certain amount of useful reading.
</p>

<p>
Peter gave details of their tour, adding that he
was not sorry to get the chance of inquiring into
the methods by which lunacy was treated in the
East, and, also, that he was beginning to be "rather
keen" on leprosy, the most common disease ever
cured by psychical, or "miraculous," powers of
old.  He studiously refrained from mentioning
Cyprian but, from the fact that his letter came direct
to Ferlie, it would appear that Aunt B. had entrusted
him with some sort of outline of the true facts.
</p>

<p>
"He was always rather a delightful person," said
Ferlie, "But I am not sure that, in his present phase,
he is likely to be particularly sympathetic."
</p>

<p>
"Peter!  Why, I always imagined him at the head
of the newest Communistic Party: his hand against
every settled law of man or nature, from birth and
vaccination to death and burial."
</p>

<p>
"That was Peter at twenty, seeking the freedom
of the Universe.  Peter at twenty-five, is a martinet
for the regulations of taxes by Cæsar and of emotions
by the Church through the Seven Sacraments."
</p>

<p>
"Never heard of them!"
</p>

<p>
"That is your loss, Cyprian," Ferlie assured him.
</p>

<p>
"I admit to having hoped," he said, ignoring
the snub, "that you would think yourself out of that
particular creed towards which circumstances forced
you.  The majority of your priests, in this country
especially, hardly inspire me to follow, as an
unquestioning disciple, in their footsteps."
</p>

<p>
"Nor me, as a rule," she owned calmly, "But
what have the priests to do with the creed?"
</p>

<p>
"It is a priest-ridden creed.  The Protestant
section, at least, leave one to deal direct with the
Highest Authority."
</p>

<p>
"Have you studied the teaching of either party?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not.  There is no need.  One judges the
tree by the fruits.  The Roman version of the law
produces bigots; the Protestant produces&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Agnostics."
</p>

<p>
He laughed, and they left it at that.  He knew
himself to be soaked in prejudice and dreaded lest
they should try to influence her against the visions
which kept her at his side&mdash;those Men in Black.
Had they not delivered over one of their, since
acknowledged, girl-saints to the stake and its flames
for seeing visions and dreaming dreams in which
their own uninspired blindness could not share?
</p>

<p>
Infallible?  Infallible!
</p>

<p>
He knew nothing of that other Cyprian, with
whose condemnation she was familiar.  He only
knew that, having Ferlie, he meant to hold.
</p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
</h3>

<p>
Certain inevitable consequences followed after
Ferlie had once put in a public appearance.
</p>

<p>
It was hardly to be supposed that, in a land
where women were scarce and men plentiful, her
sovereign-coloured hair was to be allowed to glow
unseen by the male contingent, nor her rather
absent-minded aloofness to pass unchallenged by
the solid phalanx of self-contented wives.
</p>

<p>
She could not be described as a general favourite.
Her thoughts were elsewhere; she was obliged to
act a part which failed to interest her whenever she
descended the hill to mix with her own kind.
</p>

<p>
The men, slow-witted as to any point of feminine
psychology that did not exactly jump to the eyes,
were not aware of any concealing veil, and summed
her up as quite a little bit of All-Right and decidedly
a "Beaut," but women are not so easily deceived
in one another.  They were quick to suspect that this
Ishmaelitish woman, too obviously pretty to need
the support of her own sex, and round whose chair
the men showed signs of clustering (of course!)
had not put all her cards on the table.
</p>

<p>
They attempted to dismiss her nervily distracted
attitude, her laggardly recognition of individuals
to whom she had once been introduced, and her
complete detachment from all rules of official status,
as affectation.
</p>

<p>
The words would not quite fit because her manner
was, if anything, unnaturally natural, and she was
inclined to think startling things out loud when
over-excited.  They began to discuss her rather a lot in
her absence so that new-comers became rather
prejudiced before meeting her and convinced that
here was a to-be-discouraged specimen of their
sex, seeking notoriety.  And notoriety with women
in a circle on the "Ladies'" side of the Club means
"Men"; while "Men" may mean anything.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie was to blame, in that she made no effort
to conciliate.  She had not, it must be remembered,
known initiation as a débutante into the ritual
pertaining unto the Mammon of Precedence.  All
women were alike to her, from the Leading Lady
to the Most Junior Bride whom everybody had
voted, "of the Country, my dear."  Not all men,
because, very shortly, they showed signs of desiring,
one by one, to make an individual impression.  They
began to discuss Themselves with her, preparatory
to fathoming that complex of laughter and jarringly
grave philosophy which was Herself.  And here,
her youth affected matters.  Her past tragedy had
separated her, for some while, from her fellows:
her knowledge of character necessarily rested upon
her own experience.  She was, as Cyprian had
warned her, over-pitiful to confidences she should
have checked, and tendered tolerant sympathy where
a hurt, deliberately inflicted, would have proved
the only curative physic.
</p>

<p>
This, since, ultra-sensitive to pain herself, she
could not believe in the thickness of some folk's
skins.  Her encouragement therefore, of some
unbalanced youth, whose voiced cravings for the
Good, the True and the Beautiful, were rooted in
a most natural desire to hold a pretty girl's hand,
lacked wisdom, to say the least of it.
</p>

<p>
Some time passed before Cyprian began to
speculate on her habit of drifting into corners
accompanied by this pair of Shooting Boots or that,
while a restrained current of Christian hostility,
founded on the useful direction to be angry and
sin not, oozed insinuatingly from the Women's
Fellowship.  He knew them for Nice Women, and
was sorry; likewise puzzled.  In his opinion, Ferlie
should have taken all hearts by storm.  By which
he betrayed nearly as deep a simplicity of soul as
Ferlie herself.
</p>

<p>
However, the Club, representing as it did the
unimportant world outside their fairy gates, occupied
too small a proportion of their days for him to put
his misgivings into words, and not until Digby Maur
came to the Station did a certain incident drive him
to her with protest-framing lips.
</p>

<p>
Digby Maur was not his real name.  Everybody
knew that.  But whether his mother had called him
Maung Man, or whether his father was truly a
connection of a certain Digby St. Maur, who had
retired from the country with a string of exciting
letters after his name, was never, so to speak, put
on paper.  People said things and people winked
or maintained a priggish silence.  Anyhow, Somebody
had manipulated the wires of State to make
a Government Servant of the man who called
himself Digby Maur; who had received most of
his education in a type of school connected with the
Missions, and whose brain, if not his character,
was inherited from one who did not come forward
to share the resultant fruits of it.
</p>

<p>
In appearance Digby Maur was unexpected.
Tall, supple, small-boned, his skin weakly
tea-coloured and with hair so black and shiny that it
might have been enamelled on to his head, his
eyes were fine and slanted very little under their
dark brows; his mouth was weak and romantically
bitter.
</p>

<p>
He was a man with a grievance, and a passionate
aptitude for slashing canvas with the warm bright
hues of the Eastern land to which one of his parents
belonged.  His talent for drawing had smoothed
the way for those who had placed him in a
profession where it could be exercised in moderation.
The Turneresque fruits of his recreation did not
concern them.
</p>

<p>
But they did concern Ferlie, to whom he showed
them, and enthralled her.  For her he unbandaged
his secret wounds.  He understood that the world
in general considered his nebulous father had done
the decent thing by him.  What was his grouse?
What more could the fellow expect?  All unknown
to them, and him, his paternal grandfather had
achieved a great reputation as an artist before he
died.  As things were, his own canvases told Digby
much.
</p>

<p>
"If I'd only had the chance!" he said to Ferlie.
"The power is within me.  I feel it.  And I know
that I could make my mark; perhaps found an
entirely new school of painting!  Japan has, long
ago, evolved her own style.  It has outstripped
primitive India and Burma.  Say you believe in
me!  The faith of even one human soul would be
an inspiration."
</p>

<p>
"Take it," Ferlie's admiring gaze told him,
fixed upon a sure, swift, impressionistic splashing
of Gul Mohur trees against a faintly emerald sky.
The pictures spoke to her in some subtly intimate
manner; she, the unswerving huntress after all
elusive beauty.
</p>

<p>
She and Digby began to hold long colour-struck
conversations and, under fire of her encouragement,
he neglected his office table for his easel.
</p>

<p>
To a few discerning eyes, in the modern Art
Schools of England, his latent genius might have
been apparent, but to the handful of earth-bound
treasure-seekers in the out-stations to which Digby
was ever sent, the paintings remained somewhat
incomprehensible efforts at self-expression.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie glimpsed the tragedy behind them;
wondered complicated things about little Thu Daw
and finally submitted to sit for an impression of
herself, full-length against a background of those
same fiery branches of blossom.
</p>

<p>
"The trees in my garden are now in full bloom,"
he told her.  "My bungalow fronts the river and
we shall be in perfect seclusion.  Think of the
sunlight flung back from those flower-flames to
become entangled in your hair!  A scattered
splendour of strewn petals at your feet, shadowed to
scarlet where the light falls low on the grass.
</p>

<p>
"I shall call the picture 'Imprisoned Flames,'
and shall give it to you."
</p>

<p>
"I shall give it to Cyprian," said Ferlie, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"To your brother?  Would he appreciate it?
Could he?  He doesn't"&mdash;with a laugh&mdash;"appreciate
me."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie felt that to be true.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian and she had seemed, almost by tacit
consent, to avoid discussion of Digby Maur.  But
then, they seldom discussed anybody, happy egoists
that they were.
</p>

<p>
In this case Cyprian had definite reasons for his
dislike though they were not reasons he would be
likely to confide in Ferlie.  His respect for Womanhood
in the abstract was stringently old-fashioned
for days when the modern débutante has been known
to discuss the works of Havelock Ellis with her
partner, between dances, at the latest fashionable
night-club.  Sometimes, in odd corners of the bar,
men raised their eyebrows and shrugged at the
mention of Digby's name.  He was not boycotted
by any means, but he was not exploited before
their women-folk.
</p>

<p>
"What can you expect?  This mania for 'enlightening'
education which develops the vices of
both Races and the&mdash;well, one can't but believe
in the truth of the saying.  Left to itself, the bazaar
element triumphs, and why not?&mdash;so that it flourishes
in the bazaar.  Oil and water will never mix.  And
even under this broad-minded administration one
must draw the line somewhere."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian heard, marked, learnt and inwardly digested.
</p>

<p>
Came a day when he overheard.
</p>

<p>
He had taken a hand at bridge, where the table
stood close to the half-open door of the bar, and he
sat nearest the voices which occasionally floated
through into the card-room.
</p>

<p>
"What gets my goat is, that her brother should
allow it."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think he knows?"
</p>

<p>
"She has had no use for anybody but&mdash;That&mdash;lately."
</p>

<p>
"It was a case of mutual attraction at first sight."
</p>

<p>
"Well, either someone ought to tackle him or he
ought to tackle her."
</p>

<p>
"You don't be a damn fool!  It ain't anybody's
business to tackle a grown man about the doings
of a married woman in his house.  My wife says&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Low murmurings.
</p>

<p>
"It can't be true!"
</p>

<p>
"Fact, I assure you.  Cecily saw her actually
going through his garden-gates."
</p>

<p>
"I must say I can't see the fascination these
fellows seem to exercise."
</p>

<p>
"And you'd think a girl like that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My dear fellow, do remember she is a married
woman.  Probably Sterne could do nothing, even
if he wanted to, with that hair!  What I say is,
there can't be smoke without fire."
</p>

<p>
When Cyprian revoked, Dummy got up and,
muttering of thirst, ordered drinks all round before
closing the glass doors.
</p>

<p>
The bridge-players avoided Cyprian's eyes in
saying good night.
</p>

<p>
He walked home slowly, his head buzzing.
</p>

<p>
What in the name of all that was impossible did
they think and mean?  What had Ferlie been
doing, and&mdash;here the sting!&mdash;what had she been
concealing from him?
</p>

<p>
She had, in fact, decided that the picture was to
be a birthday surprise.  She was still young enough
to attach a joyous importance to anniversaries which
he was beginning to regard as intervals of mourning,
best celebrated by a black tie.
</p>

<p>
It would not have proved difficult to extract
her simple secret had he not been too inwardly
disturbed to approach her with an unprejudiced
mind.
</p>

<p>
As it was, he began by applying an unflatteringly
descriptive adjective to Digby Maur's name, which
brought the championing colour to her cheek, before
he demanded if it were true that she had visited him
at his house.
</p>

<p>
Her chilled affirmative produced an equally
chilled request for explanation.  And now Cyprian,
himself, might have remembered her much-discussed
hair, the legacy of an Irish grandmother famed for
a quick tongue and a plucky elopement.  It made
her granddaughter say the sort of thing easier
said than forgotten.
</p>

<p>
"Narrow, narrow, narrow!  You who ought to be
so merciful to your fellow-creatures."
</p>

<p>
"No one in his senses attempts to show mercy
to a poisonous reptile."
</p>

<p>
"That's simply melodrama.  Digby Maur is a
man whose position, you, at least, should hesitate to
criticize."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks for the timely reminder.  I had, of
course, forgotten a good deal that you must constantly
recollect.  All the same, I will not have you
visiting this pseudo-artist on the transparent
pretence of arraigning his pictures."
</p>

<p>
"Did you say 'pretence,' Cyprian?"
</p>

<p>
He wanted to hurt her though in his heart he was
ashamed.  He twitched his shoulders impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," and her calm was heavy-laden.
"To leave you no excuse for using the word again,
understand that, in future, I will go where I please,
when I please, and without pretence."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that exactly, Ferlie?"
</p>

<p>
"You have no right to prevent me."
</p>

<p>
For him that ended the discussion.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose not," he answered, and walked out
of the room.
</p>

<p>
She made a quick movement as if to follow.
</p>

<p>
What she counted a sense of justice prevented
her.  It would not be fair to Digby Maur&mdash;poor
boy!&mdash;to leave him with his picture uncompleted,
merely on account of Cyprian's unprovoked
animosity.
</p>

<p>
When Cyprian understood he would be sorry.
But for his accusatory attitude she might have
been quite willing to tell him the truth.  She was a
little eager to punish him and terribly miserable
because she had left her pride no choice but to do so.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, he was asking himself what on earth
she could see in Maur.  The answer, as he supplied
it, gave him furiously to think.  Perhaps ... Youth.
</p>

<p>
An impossibly unsuitable comparison struck him.
Worshipping whole-heartedly at Ferlie's shrine,
what had he seen in Hla Byu?  No wonder Ferlie
refused to admit his right to protect her.  He had
forfeited it by his failure to protect himself from
the insidious fascination of slant-eyed laughter and
Youth's intense happiness.
</p>

<p>
Was Ferlie really attracted to&mdash;&mdash;?  But at this
point Cyprian flung himself, with drawn brows,
into his work.
</p>

<p>
They lived through three days of such Purgatory
as only the great Lovers of this earth can inflict
periodically upon themselves.
</p>

<p>
Then Ferlie, becoming desperate, betrayed her
impatience to Digby, wildly immersed in his burnt
siennas, chrome yellows and Venetian reds.
</p>

<p>
"You see, I dare say, Cyprian may be common-sensically
right about my not coming here," she
suggested with some hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"You stood up to his prejudices for my sake?
You defied him for me?"
</p>

<p>
"I did nothing of the sort," contradicted Ferlie,
hotly aware that that was exactly what she had
done, and wondering why.  If Digby took a day
longer over his wretched picture she felt that, in the
course of it, she should heave a stone at it and him.
</p>

<p>
She was angry with Cyprian for having upset her
pleasure in it, angry with herself for not having
explained accurately what was happening during
the afternoons she spent in Digby Maur's garden.
But&mdash;poor Digby again!&mdash;she all but laughed at
the pathetic figure he cut with the splotches of
brilliant paint on his forehead where he had run his
fingers through his sleek hair in despairing moments
connected with hers.
</p>

<p>
Her expression, as she regarded him in his
neglected and, to the Club folk, unrecognizable
state, reconsidering the ill-mated stock from which
he sprang, became maternally tender.
</p>

<p>
He drew his brush with a last sweep across the
canvas background and flung it down joyfully.
</p>

<p>
"Finished."
</p>

<p>
She smiled back, sensing with her uncanny
insight all the delight of achievement tingling in
his weary limbs.
</p>

<p>
That he should mis-read her sympathy was
inevitable.  The time was ripe for a climax of some
sort on his side.
</p>

<p>
... His hot kisses scorched her throat and her
disgustedly closed eyes.  His arms imprisoning her
were hungry.
</p>

<p>
It was a long while before she had hurt him
sufficiently to make him understand....
</p>

<p>
Cyprian, savagely covering sheets of office paper
with close paragraphs he constantly re-read and
re-wrote, heard her hurried step along the drive
and dully noticed that she had not stopped to sneck
the gate and, therefore, the waterman's white cow
would get at the lilies again.  He supposed Maur
had been talking more Art drivel.  Why could he
not find courage to check this nonsensical friendship
once and for all?  She did not really consider that
he had no right to object.
</p>

<p>
His pen went flying as she flung herself against
his chair.  She curled up on his knees, hiding her
face in his shoulder and breathing quickly as if
she had been running.  He glanced abstractedly at
a running rivulet of ink down a confidential report.
His relief to find her within reach again, and to
know the cold mutual politeness of the last three
days ended, was so great that all anxiety and doubt
went out in thankful amusement at the unexpectedness
of her.  He wondered if she had blown up the
whole Station with an experimental bomb, or whether
she had merely been cut by the Leading Lady.
At any rate, he was there to fill the post of Whipping
Boy, and&mdash;Heavens&mdash;how willingly!
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie," he said, half-stifled by those dear
slender arms, "What have you been doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Cyprian, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.  Just go
on forgiving me hard.  You have proved yourself
so ghastlily in the right.  Some men exist who are
not ready for toleration of their weaknesses and
sympathy in their sorrows.  Sooner or later, they
misunderstand what you offer them and turn into
Circe's beasts&mdash;and blame your attitude for the
change....  I suppose he had some reason to say
I'd asked for it; but I didn't know...."
</p>

<p>
He took her flushed face between his palms and
turned it round.
</p>

<p>
"Did he say that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  And more.  Much more.  But it was what
he did that matters.
</p>

<p>
"Go on."
</p>

<p>
"He caught hold of me and held me against
him and kissed me ... all over ... I thought I
had done with that brand of kisses for ever.  And he
wouldn't let me move.  And at last I got a chance
to b-bite ... and, oh, Cyprian, it was all so
hopelessly vulgar!  I'm bruised with the smirch of it.
I'll never leave the house again till I die, unless
you are with me to tell me whom I can safely speak
to.  I'll never trust my wits, henceforth, beyond the
front gate.  I&mdash;what are you laughing at?  Don't
laugh!  Why are you finding it funny, when I only
want you to <i>wash</i> me and&mdash;and comfort me?"
</p>

<p>
"It's all very well, but I am glad this has
happened, my dear."
</p>

<p>
"Glad!"
</p>

<p>
"You needed some such"&mdash;he was about to say
"lesson" and veered away from the priggishness
of the word&mdash;"experience, to keep you in my
despised conventional way.  Now, tell me.  Are
Maur's intentions strictly&mdash;er&mdash;honourable?"
</p>

<p>
"Honourable!  What are you talking about, and
will you stop smiling?"
</p>

<p>
Her head tucked itself out of sight again under
his chin and he rested his lips an instant on it
before explaining.
</p>

<p>
"I mean, is he wanting to marry you?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sure I don't know.  I should think it
hardly likely now.  If so, he can't have considered
that my reception of his advances augured matrimonial
bliss.  But you were all out to put him in a
lethal chamber before and now you seem to be
excusing him."
</p>

<p>
"To him, I am your somewhat elderly brother;
you are a widow, and of age, who lives with me
pending the next suitor on the scene.  No one could
imagine, who does not know the truth, that there
will not be several others, and, amongst them,
someone to whom you might reasonably be expected
to listen.  I have my own small sense of Justice, you
see," Cyprian finished dryly.  "And I, of all men,
should have learnt to be merciful."
</p>

<p>
"Touché," admitted Ferlie.  "It is my turn to
tell you to go on.  But what do you expect me to
do about his lunatic scheming and dreaming?"
</p>

<p>
"I expect you, just for this once, to do as you are
told.  What I am going to do is what I should have
done in the first place: forbid him to speak to
my&mdash;sister.  So much is simple.  But I am looking
ahead, and I think you should, in the circumstances,
cultivate women-friends more and men less!"
</p>

<p>
She made a little face before she said meekly.
</p>

<p>
"They don't seem so anxious to cultivate me,
you see, as the men."
</p>

<p>
He chuckled.  "I'd noticed that."
</p>

<p>
"You have no right to start being unexpected,
Cyprian, at this stage of things.  It's so humiliating
when I have been browsing contentedly on the
belief that I can foresee all that you are likely to
foresee and notice."
</p>

<p>
"It is not the first time, is it, that I have made
an effort to exceed my rights?"
</p>

<p>
"Please resist the temptation to go on driving it
home.  According to the Book you should be striding
the room muttering dire threats through your
clenched teeth."
</p>

<p>
"Concerning your behaviour or his?"
</p>

<p>
Then, as she wriggled her annoyance, the laughter
in the heart of him materialized.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, I am incapable, at the moment, of
taking anything seriously except the fact that you
have come back to me.  Which is a matter rather
for rejoicing than for imprecations.  If I seem to
pass off this occurrence as unimportant, it is only
because it is so over-shadowed by the importance of
the realization that I exist again for you."
</p>

<p>
"I have never imagined you existed for anyone
else," she protested indignantly.  "Another time
you'll know that when it looks as if I were thinking
of someone else it's really that I am concentrating
extra hard on something connected with your
happiness."
</p>

<p>
"I'll remember," Cyprian promised, slightly
catching his breath.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
They had dismissed Digby Maur and his picture
too airily.  His suffering was intense enough to cause
his hatred of Cyprian to reflect again on Ferlie.
</p>

<p>
Everybody in the Club could see that he and
Mrs. Clifford no longer held sweet converse together
nor walked in that House of Rimmon as friends.
Its numerous unmystical members openly rejoiced
that Sterne had, at last, put his foot down.
</p>

<p>
The iron entered into Digby Maur's soul.  His
was not the nature to forgo visions of public
revenge.  Ferlie was involved in them because,
although he had unjustifiably presumed upon her
frank comradeship to the extent of insulting her,
his desire, outweighing the elements of purer passion
which she had primarily awakened in him, was an
emotion more likely to breed wounded resentment
than humble submission, on the well-deserved
withdrawal of its star.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie, though secretly confessing herself
blame-worthy, realized too thoroughly by now that
dynamite, in proximity with a match-box however
innocently decorated, is not a reliable combination,
and, having once capitulated to Cyprian's judgment,
could be safely trusted to abide by it.
</p>

<p>
Hence, even an armed truce was out of the
question.  She welcomed with relief the news that
Digby had taken casual leave and gone to Rangoon.
</p>

<p>
"It shows he has accepted the position and means
to be sensible," she told Cyprian.  "When he
returns we can meet as club-acquaintances and it
will be forgotten that we ever appeared to be
anything more."
</p>

<p>
"Burma does not forget," he said cloudily, and
she understood that he had learnt that lesson
bitterly enough.
</p>

<p>
She might have been less sanguine of a happy
ending to her own affair if she had connected
with Maur's departure a detailed announcement in
the Rangoon papers of a forthcoming Art Exhibition,
on a large scale, and for which contributions were
invited in the form of original sketches, paintings,
leather-work, pottery and all the usual articles
universally acknowledged, on such occasions, a
joy for ever.
</p>

<p>
Shrewdly positive that he possessed a work of
Art worth exhibiting, and a golden opportunity of
advertising his hitherto unexploited talent, Digby
Maur had well-timed his leave.  All individuals
occupying the local seats of the Mighty would be
present; besides, at this height of the Season,
many outside visitors.
</p>

<p>
There must follow comment and inquiries as to
the identity of the artist who had produced
"Imprisoned Flames."
</p>

<p>
He was right.  There were visitors, and, among
them, a millionaire on a private steam-yacht and
his personal physician; a young man with an
inquisitive expression, reddish hair and a loud happy
voice which he dogmatically raised upon matters
which the Elderly and Unenterprising had long
elected to approach with caution.
</p>

<p>
In due course the new-comers found themselves
conducted by the residents, to the Art Show, where
the chief item was already admitted to be a unique
painting which most people only remembered as
the Girl and the Gul Mohurs, though the artist had
baptized it more erotically.
</p>

<p>
Said Peter to his neighbour, after a cursory glance,
"Why, that's my sister!"
</p>

<p>
Several people turned, and, amongst them, a
hovering Anglo-Burman, referred to in hushed tones
as the artist.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Maddock put up his eye-glass with an
astounded, "Bless my soul!  It <i>is</i> Ferlie.  Where
on earth did the little minx have it done?"
</p>

<p>
"It's damned good," said Peter.  "Probably
it is Cyprian's.  I'd like to have a copy.  When we
run them to earth we will ask them why they never
told us it was here."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel and Peter never discussed the fugitives.
</p>

<p>
Aunt B., mistrusting the frailty of human flesh,
had not mentioned the relationship under which
they were masquerading.  They might have already
dropped it in anticipation of the divorce to which
in common sense they must finally succumb.  Better,
she thought, to let Ferlie tell her own tale to Peter.
She had not foreseen that Ferlie would delay too
long in replying to Peter's letter, on the basis that
least said on paper soonest mended.
</p>

<p>
So Peter and the Colonel only knew that the two
were together and that Ferlie's name was
Mrs. Clifford to stave off the world's curiosity.
</p>

<p>
Digby Maur was already lionized, and, being
Digby Maur, his head already felt a little light.
</p>

<p>
He longed for Ferlie and Cyprian to hear of his
triumph at first hand, and appreciated, with a
tinge of malice, that the daily papers would afford
Cyprian a resentful shock over the publicity bestowed
upon the painting of Ferlie.
</p>

<p>
He decided to find means of introducing himself
to explain that the picture was not for sale.
</p>

<p>
The opportunity occurred sooner than he expected,
by way of a lady who had once known the man
reputed to be Digby Maur's father, and who felt
sorry for the quasi-European son, and glad of his
success.  She had met the Colonel, and, aware of
the respect in which the Banks held him, thought
to put the young artist in touch with a possible order
for Burmese sketches.  Finding herself near Peter
she manœuvred the two opposite one another and
was about to explain that Digby was the artist of
"that red painting," when a friend jostled against
her in the crowd and engaged her in conversation.
Peter and Digby, barely introduced, were left face
to face.
</p>

<p>
"I must say you have not even a family resemblance
to your brother," hazarded Digby.
</p>

<p>
"Which is not surprising," and Peter eyed him
with interest, "seeing that I have no brother."
</p>

<p>
Maur recalled the Club conclusion of Cyprian's
relationship to Ferlie.
</p>

<p>
"I should have said your half-brother, Mr. Sterne."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you've met old Cyprian?  No, he is not
even my half-brother, though people used to take
him for an uncle.  He is just an old family friend.
But if you have met him you may know my kiddie-sister.
She is staying with him in Burma at present."
</p>

<p>
A sudden unhealthy pallor left his companion's
face putty-coloured.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't catch your name," Peter was saying
when Digby recovered his breath.  "Mine's
Carmichael.  My sister is a Mrs. Clifford."
</p>

<p>
He slightly over-emphasized the unfamiliar title.
</p>

<p>
The eyes scrutinizing him narrowed.
</p>

<p>
"I have had the honour of painting Mrs. Clifford."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!  Then it was you&mdash;&mdash;"  Peter studied
him afresh and stopped, faintly uneasy.  This man
must know Ferlie quite well.  What on earth had
made him suppose Cyprian his brother&mdash;or hers?
Better not inquire, lest he should put his foot on
some unexplained situation.  He drifted into
enthusiastic comment on the portrait and escaped to warn
Colonel Maddock of the artist's identity.  He had
been prepared for an equivocal attitude from the
narrow-minded, who might criticize Ferlie's staying
with a friend of Cyprian's calibre.  Odd of Cyprian
to rush her off like that to Burma.  The uncle part
could be overdone.  Aunt B. had said they were
living in the wilds and seeing no one, so it had
appeared not to matter.  He had assumed them lost
to both hemispheres till Ferlie should become
stronger after her troubles and able to make some
satisfactory arrangement with Clifford.
</p>

<p>
She should have confided in her mother, or her
only brother long ago.  Of course he saw that she
could not be left to the care of a chap who, from
Aunt B.'s hints, was little better than a maniac on
one point, however sane he might be on all others.
Like the Vane woman, he would probably end in
a Home, unless&mdash;and Peter eagerly recalled certain
experiments he had been requested to make in
Ruth Levine's flat and on the efficacy of which he
was now awaiting her final verdict.  He was so
"keen" on insanity and if his ideas consolidated
into success there seemed no limit to his horizon.
</p>

<p>
His gaze into space grew abstracted and he
dismissed Maur's inquiry with a shrug.  People
always took for granted that old Cyprian was some
sort of a relation: this fellow had obviously noticed
that Ferlie did not use the prefix "Uncle," and
had assumed the rest.
</p>

<p>
Rum chap, Cyprian.  A queer friend for her to
have stuck to all these years.  He really must hint
to her, though, that she could not, in any country,
pay an indefinite visit to a man friend, however
elderly, without asking for the acidulated comments
of catty women and coarse-minded men.
</p>

<p>
By the time he found the Colonel that gentleman
had already been presented to Maur; who had made
hay to some purpose; having decided to try another
tack and assume Cyprian something different from
a brother, this time.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have had the great privilege of painting
Mrs. Clifford, sir.  Do you happen to be acquainted
with her husband?"
</p>

<p>
The Colonel was grateful for the lead.  He thought
Peter had suggested that Ferlie was posing as a
widow.  Much better to have admitted separation,
since, at this distance, awkward questions could not
be answered anyway.
</p>

<p>
"I have met him and have no desire to meet him
again.  You can take it from me, Mr. Maur, that
she was altogether wise in insisting that they should
live their lives apart.  As for your picture of her
I should have much pleasure..." etc., etc.
</p>

<p>
He certainly thought he must have done Ferlie
a good turn if this man should be a talker.  The
chances were now people would get to know the
husband was impossible.  He blandly concentrated
on the picture.
</p>

<p>
"This one is not for sale," Digby assured him.
"But if I can persuade Mrs. Clifford to sit again&mdash;and
I think that will be possible&mdash;I should be happy
to execute you a fresh order, though I never
reproduce.  I wonder if a bank of our red lilies and the
hint of a gold pagoda-roof in the middle distance,
reflected in water&mdash;you have visited the lakes?"
</p>

<p>
Maddock eventually gave the order for another
portrait, subject to Ferlie's acquiescence.
</p>

<p>
"We shall be hoping to arrange a meeting soon.
Must run up to Mandalay first."
</p>

<p>
However, after an interview with Peter, they both
came to the conclusion that Ferlie should not have
left her nearest friends so much in the dark as to her
tactics.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt B. declared that she was calling herself
a widow," said Peter, "hence the 'Mrs. Clifford.'  It
was easier to avoid publicity and the interest of
the folk who covet their neighbour's peace of mind.
The 'brother' mistake is fishy preceding his attitude
to you.  We must pick our way if we don't want to
get Ferlie's name handed round with the ice-cream
at every official show going.  When we see her I
shall put it to her straight."
</p>

<p>
Digby Maur's leave at an end, Government House
had shaken him warmly by the hand.  He had gained
for himself a reputation, and the power to shatter one.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
</h3>

<p>
"Ferlie," said Cyprian, one morning, pushing
back his chair from the breakfast-table, "are you
feeling all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Feeling all&mdash;what do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"You're not, then?"
</p>

<p>
Her smile was uncertain.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be silly!  Why should I be feeling wrong?"
</p>

<p>
"That's just what I have been asking myself
for more than a week.  The Hot Weather is not
nearly upon us yet."
</p>

<p>
"I'm quite well," she insisted listlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Then, what is the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian, don't tease," and her unnerved vexation
contained, he imagined, a hint of alarm; "there
is nothing the matter.  Though I see you are
determined to believe that a lie."
</p>

<p>
"It is one," he replied, opening the newspaper.
</p>

<p>
She resorted to a stormy exit.
</p>

<p>
What else could she do when he was right?
It seemed sometimes a great deal too high, the price
she was paying to preserve their flawless peace.  At
least, it had been flawless until Digby Maur returned
from Rangoon, but not to fall easily into his niche
as a casual acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
She wondered, when she sat staring at him on the
river-bank below the garden with its wild, concealing
foliage, why she had never before thought of
comparing his eyes to a snake's.
</p>

<p>
He painted on, grimly speechless, but when they
travelled over her, devoid of expression, coldly alive,
she could have fled in panic.  And she had got to
see the thing out or everyone would learn that
Cyprian had brought her here under false colours
and that, somewhere in England, dwelt her husband,
complacently aware of their flight.
</p>

<p>
The scandal would force Cyprian to resign, to
whom public criticism of his private affairs, even in
simple matters, was real torture.  For him, through
her, to be obliged to retire on an inadequate pension
in a tempest of slander was unthinkable.
</p>

<p>
Why had she been such a fool as to shrink from
confiding, by letter, in Peter?
</p>

<p>
It had seemed immaterial whether she did so or
not, considering that, in Rangoon, one could safely
assume nobody had heard of her existence, and he
and the Colonel were not contemplating a long stay
anywhere.
</p>

<p>
Peter at present, she knew, made a remorselessly
logical Catholic with no time for visions unsanctioned
by the Pope.  Order and discipline everywhere, if
you please, for Peter, once as thoroughly lawless
as he now showed himself law-ridden.  But Peter
was an extremist in everything.  He had really
little use for the non-fanatic who hesitates to sacrifice,
at any rate, his neighbour's Life and Limb, for his
opinions.  But, while he had made his submission
to Rome in calm, wholehearted conviction, which
might or might not, in another ten years, be followed
by as calm and wholehearted a recantation, annulled
in its turn by a general clear-up of his whole life
and a death-bed repentance&mdash;"for, though it may
be a darned uncomfortable religion to live in, it's
the only tidy one to die in," had ever, like Charles
Stuart, maintained Peter&mdash;Ferlie had crept through
the gate as a battered ship creeps gratefully into an
unexpectedly discovered harbour, anchorless, after
the storm.
</p>

<p>
She had found there warmth and healing and a kind
of companionship among the angels that only very
sensitive worshippers of abstract holiness know.
The Unseen Hosts were to her lone spirit so really
present at the altar steps that she could no longer
consider the most deserted church empty.  Doctrinally,
she was unsound.  Authority had recognized
the bewildered pulsing of a heart too bruised
for searching examination, and admitted her with
far less circumspection than they accorded Peter
of the minutely inquiring habit of mind.
</p>

<p>
The Peters are well known later to deny; not so
the Ferlies.
</p>

<p>
By reason of that very loyal complex in her was
Ferlie passively chained to the Force from which
she had once drawn strength, since there could be
no severing of her fetters without a severance also
from those who had comforted her in affliction.
How mean to accept the sweets and deny the obligations
incurred!  To question only the rules which
affected her personal desires!
</p>

<p>
That Force had stood by her in her darkness:
therefore she must stand by it now that she walked
in sunshine.
</p>

<p>
Yet, Cyprian was wondering whether she would
outthrow superstition when happiness set in, and
she was sure that, if so, he would soon persuade
himself, for her sake, that, though divorce in itself
might be an evil thing, in their case it became a
necessary good.  Clifford could be trusted to make
things easy; he to whom all women were merely,
Woman.
</p>

<p>
The doors would swing wide on very little pressure
(... <i>Et ne nos inducas in tentationem</i>).
</p>

<p>
Since, white-faced and petrified, she had undertaken
to deceive Cyprian, and steal by secret ways
and unworthy evasions into Digby Maur's garden,
yielding him the triumph of another picture in return
for his promised silence, she had conversed with him
only in monosyllables and, since he earnestly desired
to complete the commission which might set him
on the road to future recognition, he had borne her
self-absorbed misery without making any attempt
to counteract it or effect a reconcilation.  His
feelings towards her at that time were an irreconcilable
mixture of angry desire and aching remorse.
</p>

<p>
The picture completed, it was his intention to make
a final effort to re-arouse her forfeited pity.  If she
should throw up the sponge before he were ready
he determined to stick at nothing which should force
her and that canting Sterne to eat the dust of the
same humiliation they had publicly heaped upon him.
</p>

<p>
He was incapable of believing that they were not
lovers in the term's worst accepted sense.  And
what man has done man can do, and the woman who
takes one step in that direction will take another,
he promised himself.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie, nervous of Cyprian's penetration in the
matter, attacked Digby one afternoon, when the
work was about half finished.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you quite understand," she said,
"the strain this deception is putting upon me.
Cyprian is inventing reasons in his own mind for
my looking so ill.  But I simply can't sleep."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him then."
</p>

<p>
"Do you really imagine that he would allow you
to finish this, if I did?"
</p>

<p>
"In that case I should distinctly advise you not
to tell him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you are a cad!" she burst out.  "What
man, worthy of the name, would take advantage of
a private confidence inadvertently yielded, to further
his own ends?"
</p>

<p>
"You forget," he said, "your Cyprian never,
from the beginning, would admit that I was worthy
of the name.  Do you happen to know the terms
in which he forbade me your company?"
</p>

<p>
"Whatever he said he was right."
</p>

<p>
"Why not, therefore, resign yourself to the worst
where my actions are under discussion?"
</p>

<p>
"We had an agreement before T consented to this
course," she reminded him.  "I suppose you will
not forget it."
</p>

<p>
"I denied any intention of employing tactics
which had already failed to make you see my side."  There
was a sneer in his voice.  "I have, nevertheless,
abided by the word of a&mdash;no, I'll spare you.
You started this conversation, not I."
</p>

<p>
She relapsed into hopeless silence.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I have not suffered too?" he asked,
more humanely.  "Once, you would have noticed
that I am hardly looking as if my own nights were
undisturbed."
</p>

<p>
Then, as she answered nothing, "You had better
ask Sterne where he intends to bring up his son that
no stigma shall attach to his name in future as he
seems persuaded it does to mine."
</p>

<p>
"You could save yours if you wished," she said,
in tired tones.  "It is what we are that matters,
not what other people think we are."
</p>

<p>
"You may not be the hypocrite you seem.  But
as for your reputed brother ..."
</p>

<p>
"I think, if I were you, I'd leave it at that," Ferlie
told him, so significantly that he paused and passed
the rest of the sentence off with an unpleasant laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand exactly what you remind
me of," was his next opening.  "Have you, in
England, any legends referring to the spirits of
trees?  We, in Burma, people our mountains and
rivers and trees with 'nats,' which are powerfully
angelic or demoniac spirits, but the tree-nats are
the most popular, I think.  I might have painted you
as my conception of a Gul Mohur Nat, but, then,
you would have had to stand nude among the
shadows&mdash;hardly visible, but still nude, with the dull
golden reflections of the flowers upon your pale skin."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie looked back steadily into the hard brightness
of his eyes.
</p>

<p>
The attitude of purely English Club members
might be, in part, responsible for the
character-development here of weak expansiveness into bitter
withdrawal, and natural animal passion to the
impotent rage of unnatural excesses which lent him
a spurious sense of power.
</p>

<p>
The real power on this occasion lay in her own
self-control, and she knew it.
</p>

<p>
She spoke impersonally.  "There is a story of
the first Old Master to paint from the nude.  It is
not a story that appeals to me, somehow.  The
model and the artist regarded the occasion so sacred
as to warrant their joint attendance at Mass first.
Myself, I feel that they should never have realized
the suggestion of lust, in anything so aloof as Art,
enough to anticipate its interference."
</p>

<p>
She astonished and disconcerted him where he had
hoped to disconcert her.
</p>

<p>
"You would, therefore, have raised no objection?"
rather lamely.
</p>

<p>
"I should assuredly have refused&mdash;you.  There
is a form of Art, which only artists of a higher
evolution than you are fit to practise.  My objection
would not have been founded on any idea that the
human body must be concealed to all for the sake
of those who misread its allegorical beauty."
</p>

<p>
He unscrewed a fresh tube with savagely nervous
fingers, and descended to cheap reviling.
</p>

<p>
"Sterne, I gather, is one of the fortunately evolved
specimens who do not misread the allegory and are,
hence, privileged without the artist's excuse."
</p>

<p>
"Your thoughts just bore me," said Ferlie flatly.
"I can see them passing across your face and they
are ugly enough to mar any work you attempt.
And, underneath all my angry disgust, I am sorry
for you.  If you came across a wounded snake what
would you do?"
</p>

<p>
The palette crashed to the ground as he took a
pace forward, clenching his stained hands.
</p>

<p>
"Put it out of its pain," he said.
</p>

<p>
A faint shadow of that hypnotic power, which
Peter had so long suspected and, finally, developed
in himself, supported her.
</p>

<p>
"If you are, as I believe you to be, a true artist
under your skin," and she kept very still, "you will
practise the restraint which should enable you to
put your picture before your&mdash;passions.  I have stood
long enough for to-day."
</p>

<p>
She turned swiftly and retreated through the trees;
nor did he attempt to call her back.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of the week Cyprian, who had
left Ferlie at the Club surrounded by a new batch
of English papers, and ridden out, himself, to an
inspection connected with his work at some distance,
returned late in the afternoon, to find her missing.
</p>

<p>
"Your sister, Mr. Sterne?  No.  She only stayed
at the Club about a quarter of an hour."
</p>

<p>
Someone had seen her walking towards the river-path.
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll go home that way, skirting the hill,"
said Cyprian.  "The servant met me with a telegram
for her, having been to the bungalow and found her
out."
</p>

<p>
He rode slowly off, flicking at the flies with his
crop.  Once on the narrow path above the bank he
let the horse pick its own way.  The back compounds
of one or two bungalows, set far apart, straggled
to the bushy slope above the water, but the vicinity
of the river was too feverish in the evening to be
popular, and it struck Cyprian as particularly unwise
of Ferlie to choose this spot for a walk, in her present
languid state of health.
</p>

<p>
He made up his mind to tackle her outright when
they got home and insist upon knowing what was
worrying her.  He had taken refuge in patience,
but she sometimes needed rousing by sharper methods.
</p>

<p>
There might have arrived a letter from Peter
criticizing what Cyprian felt to be none of that
gentleman's business.  As an only brother, and older
than Ferlie, it was possible that Peter's scruples
had outweighed his discretion.  Cyprian, having
overcome his own, was not prepared for re-discussion
of the situation with anybody.  To have and to hold,
whatever the future brought to either of them.  He
would plough the furrow now to the very end.
</p>

<p>
As he registered this resolve afresh, he heard voices
ahead, but their owners were hidden behind a natural
crescent of thick undergrowth which somebody had
attempted, in the past, to train as a rude hedge.
Above the tumble of scattered bushes appeared the
ragged outline of a garden, flanked by two huge
Gul Mohurs.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian recognized them as those which stood
in Digby Maur's compound, reflecting with satisfaction
that the latter had remained largely invisible
since his return from leave.
</p>

<p>
The ruin of decaying vegetation on the dank path
muffled the sound of his horse's hoofs and he had
passed within a few yards of the foliage concealing
the speakers when the identity of one was revealed
to him.
</p>

<p>
"I told you yesterday that you make me pity
you, in spite of myself," Ferlie was saying excitedly.
"I am speaking cold sense when I repeat that it will
be impossible for me to hide much longer from
Cyprian that I am not spending my afternoons at
the Club.  I actually had to go there to-day to avoid
questions before he went out into the district."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's no use," Digby Maur's huskily uneven
tones replied.  "You're great on 'control' and all
that, and the means you employ to get here do not
concern me.  You will continue to come for as long
as I need you, because you can't help yourself; and
I am not nearly finished with you yet."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian, on this statement, became entirely primitive
man, and did not wait to consider the metamorphosis.
He dismounted, crashed through the interlacing
branches, and found himself standing between
Ferlie and the individual who had made this
astounding claim on her time.
</p>

<p>
The air was pregnant with the labouring emotions
of a drama as old as the world.
</p>

<p>
Digby Maur recovered first from the intrusion,
for, aware that he now had his back to the wall he
was, also, reliant on the sharpness of his teeth.
Sterne was the kind of man to sell his soul in avoiding
a scandal should such a drastic price be required
of him.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening," he said.  "These are my grounds
and you will be ready to admit that even my humble
home is my castle?"
</p>

<p>
For answer, the intruder stepped forward and
slashed him across the face with the riding-crop.
</p>

<p>
The insolently poised figure reeled backwards as
Cyprian spoke to Ferlie.
</p>

<p>
"The horse is here.  I am going to put you up
on it and lead it home.  You don't look fit to walk."
</p>

<p>
Without a word she went with him down the
slope.  She would have refused his help in mounting
only that he lifted her bodily and set her sideways
on the saddle, putting the reins between her nerveless
fingers.
</p>

<p>
The dull thudding progress of the horse was out
of time with her quickening pulses....  Something
in the life of Cyprian and herself was over, and of
the new phase which loomed ahead she was afraid.
</p>

<p>
Arrived at the house she motioned him away and
slipped unaided to the ground.  He tossed the reins
to a servant and followed her up the path to his office.
She sank into a chair and sat motionless resting her
chin in her palms, dimly aware that he had passed
into his dressing-room.  She heard the splutter of
a syphon, and immediately he returned to push a
weak mixture towards her.  "Drink it up," he
ordered in matter-of-fact tones.  "And then, just
when you're ready, Ferlie, you can begin."
</p>

<p>
So he had not forgotten his promise.  Cyprian
never made the same mistake twice.  It took a long
while for her to tell him, and during the whole recital
he refrained from interruption.  When she ended he
drew a deep breath and stretched out a hand through
the gathering dusk to lay it over hers in the old
protective way.
</p>

<p>
"I have this to say," he told her.  "We are
through with any childish arguments concerning
one another's rights.  You have taken no irrevocable
vows to obey me&mdash;in fact, I believe the word has
lately been deleted from the orthodox marriage
service, has it not?&mdash;but our united brains must be
clear upon the point that two cannot walk together
unless they are agreed, and, as it is impossible for
two human souls of widely different impulses to agree
identically upon the treatment of every problem they
may be called upon to solve, it is necessary that in
final decisions one should yield precedence to the
other.  In visionary matters beyond my ken I am
willing to sit at your feet.  Over practical matters
and the verdicts that affect our material welfare,
I claim precedence, Ferlie.  You gave it to me when
you gave yourself into my keeping at Black Towers.
I am responsible for you; not you for me.  Are
you satisfied for this to be so?"
</p>

<p>
It was not in her power to speak, but she bowed her
weary puzzled head over his hand and rested it
there.  He laid his free one upon her hair and
continued speaking, while he absently smoothed the
ruffled "bob."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?  Well, in the circumstances, you had no
shadow of right to take the law into your own hands
and act deliberately against my wishes, just because
my trust in you was too complete for me to conceive
the possibility of such a thing.  If that trust between
us is to remain solid, our problems, in the future,
will have to be shared.  Neither must spare the other
for a mistaken sense of self-sacrifice.  You would not
hide your joys from me&mdash;why, then, your sorrows?
Again, I ask you: are you satisfied that I am right?"
</p>

<p>
"You know," said Ferlie's muffled tones.  "You
know...."
</p>

<p>
"Do I?  Then I am going to extract a promise
from you, here and now, that you will be fair with me,
as I have been fair with you.  Did I lie to you after
the return of Hla Byu into our joint lives?  Did I
leave you and withdraw to fight my battle alone
when she drowned herself?  I wonder whether
the earthly years make a difference, Ferlie, after all?
I wonder whether you are capable of understanding
what love means to a man who has lived nearly
half a century without it, and who suddenly finds
himself face to face with its illimitable mysteries?
Surely, you will admit the fact that, since my
probation has been double yours, I have earned the
inevitable right to lead before I follow?"
</p>

<p>
Even then she did not stir under the strengthening
touch of his sensitive fingers.
</p>

<p>
"Lead on," she said....

CHAPTER XVI
</h3>

<p>
Said the Most Important Lady, she always knew
that there was something queer about it.  "Looks
as if the whole of his ultimate objections to
Mr. Maur were rooted in the fact that he knew Maur
would probably let it out."
</p>

<p>
"But how did Maur himself find it out?"
</p>

<p>
"Probably the girl told him."
</p>

<p>
"Sounds hardly possible.  Why should she?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear!  He is not a young man exactly
and she was obviously attracted by Maur.  Hence
these stripes!"
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen his face?"
</p>

<p>
"The men are rather inclined to doubt Maur's
version."
</p>

<p>
"My dear!  The men!  She'd have had them
all in tow if she hadn't suddenly concentrated upon
Maur and disgusted everybody.  Men are wax
when it comes to a red head and a white skin.
Children!"
</p>

<p>
"But what does Maur exactly say?"
</p>

<p>
"Apparently Sterne saw green over the portrait-sittings
and insulted him.  Maur referred him to his
own little indiscretion and all parties began to snarl
about their rights.  The girl appears to have played
the part of passive resister to both sides.  That Type
of Woman....  Well, Sterne lost his temper and
hit Maur unawares when he was quite defenceless,
and then the girl rushed between them and gave away
the true relationship.  From what one gathers, she
was infatuated with Maur&mdash;got him to paint her
twice over for an excuse to be with him&mdash;and, while
he remained under the impression that she was
Sterne's widowed sister, he admits to having
considered the possibilities of matrimony.  His discovery
of what she really was&mdash;you know they say the husband
divorced her and is still alive?&mdash;startled him
into confessing that his feelings had altered in one
respect.
</p>

<p>
"There was nothing for it then but for her to go
home with Sterne; and Maur can hardly be blamed
for doing his duty by this credulous Station which
has also been suffering under the delusion that all
was square and above-board."
</p>

<p>
"For the sake of the natives alone, one's got to be
so down upon That Sort of Thing in this country."
</p>

<p>
"All the same," drawled the more tolerant voice
of Somebody's Husband, "I don't see how anybody
has suffered particularly except the Eternal Triangle.
I've always considered Sterne a jolly decent fellow,
and Mrs. Clifford not nearly so red-haired as Maur
has probably painted her."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think the whole business is fishy.  There's
something horrid about a household, in any case,
which brazenly maintains that kind of Burmese
child; and John is probably the co-respondent's
son of the divorce case.  The co-respondent can't
be Sterne or, surely, he'd have married her.  Probably
the real man bunked after marrying her, and Sterne,
aware that his own past would not bear too close a
scrutiny, took pity on her and..."
</p>

<p>
"Aren't we getting on a little fast, Dolly?  It
makes a good story, I'll admit, but we couldn't hold
to it in the face of a summons for libel, and you
know you want to send the boys to Winchester."
</p>

<p>
In the bar one heard a good bit of low chuckling.
</p>

<p>
"And Diogenes wearing the air of a Trappist
monk through the whole joke!"
</p>

<p>
"All the same, when it comes to bringing a
woman of that stamp into a respectable God-fearing
district, and introducing her to its wives and daughters
under false pretences, it's a bit thick."
</p>

<p>
"Of course he'll have to go."
</p>

<p>
"Good God, yes!  He'll have to go."
</p>

<p>
"And I shouldn't be sorry to kick out Digby Maur
along with him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Maur!  His doings cut no ice.  But, somehow,
we have looked upon Sterne as a creature with
principles, and I, for one, am sorry for this smash-up."
</p>

<p>
"Personally, I was dashed keen on the little lady."
</p>

<p>
"Well, none of the crowd were better than they
should be.  Still, I am glad that someone has
whacked Maur.  I can't quite believe in his injured
innocence.  If he didn't deserve a licking for this
he's simply asked for it elsewhere, for many moons.
But I hate a rotten show of this sort in any Station.
I wish Sterne would hurry up and get out.  But
wherever they go in Burma now, people can hardly
be expected to call."
</p>

<p class="thought">

</p>

<p>
Yes, most decidedly Cyprian would have to go.
The children complicated matters, particularly Thu
Daw.  Otherwise, things were made easier by
Peter's telegram which Cyprian had forgotten to
give Ferlie until the morning after that interview
in Digby Maur's garden.
</p>

<p>
It was a long telegram explaining that Maddock
had been invited to betake himself, and party, on a
visit to the Andaman Islands, where an old friend
of his was acting as Chief Commissioner.
</p>

<p>
"Bring John and come self Cyprian if possible,"
ended the telegram.
</p>

<p>
"It's so like Peter to prepay the reply in order to
give me no time to think," said Ferlie.  "Do we go,
Cyprian?"
</p>

<p>
That they should separate she did not contemplate
for a moment.  But he glanced at Thu Daw before
raising questioning eyes to her.
</p>

<p>
She picked up the gurgling golden-skinned atom
and smiled at him over its head.
</p>

<p>
"Why!  We have no choice in the matter."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't, my dear, but you..."
</p>

<p>
"Have none either, then," said Ferlie.
</p>

<p>
He had sent in his resignation.
</p>

<p>
"And from now on," he said inconsequently,
"it is to be the truth?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" she asked.  "Can anything hurt
us so long as we are together?"
</p>

<p>
His answering smile was very wistful.
</p>

<p>
"I had great ideas of protecting and caring for
the woman I loved when I was twenty-eight,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"And I had great ideas of protecting the man I
loved when I was seven," said Ferlie.
</p>

<p>
She gently placed little Thu Daw on his feet and
took up her position along the side of his chair,
drawing his arm around her.
</p>

<p>
"When you come to think of it, Cyprian, it was
very stupid of us not to guess that we couldn't live
without one another.  The night I was frightened,
and you came up and told me about Muriel!  Do
you remember I wanted you to marry the vicar's
daughter in my sublime faith that her home-made
chocolate fudge would utterly console?  And you
promised that whoever you married you'd always
love me best.  And then, I was the first to marry,
eleven years later.  Oh, Cyprian, Cyprian!  I
want to get out&mdash;I want to get out of the cage."
</p>

<p>
Her sudden sobbing hurt him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't, dear.  We are out.  To me, we seem
the great exception to every rule on earth."
</p>

<p>
"But earth isn't the end of everything," Ferlie
gasped, "and you'll see that too, some day; even
if I were to take advantage of your blindness now.
Is there not one corner in all this wide world where
you and I can hide ourselves with John and Thu
Daw and live out our friendship in peace?"
</p>

<p>
"Dear, you've given me the key and I have turned
the lock.  The bolt is on the inside.  I yielded up
some none-too-solid convictions to your mysticism;
cannot you, in return, yield a little of your mysticism
to my common sense?  We are in the twentieth
century: it is a day of elastic ideas for all who have
imbibed the plain truth that to live in peace we must
let our neighbours live in peace.  The minimum
observance of Herd Law, and Civilization is satisfied.
As a woman who has divorced her husband&mdash;in the
last divorce bill we can find cause for that without
touching upon more personal reasons&mdash;you'd be
remarried to a man who had had a son by a dead
Burmese girl.  The position would, at least, be
comprehensible, even to the narrow-minded.  Why are
we torturing ourselves with the precepts of a dead
Jewish Teacher, whose dead words are only kept
in evidence by those to whose interest it is to exploit
them?"
</p>

<p>
He spoke with quick diffidence, pricked by the
thought that he was literally attacking her God.
</p>

<p>
The circumstances in which they were living might
meet with the censure of the Church's accumulated
wisdom and understanding of human nature, but
he would have had her oppose directly the inflexible
word of One who taught all lovers that His Name is
Love.
</p>

<p>
She pulled herself together and stood up, spreading
wide her arms as if to embrace the light which
eluded her.
</p>

<p>
"This much I will yield, Cyprian.  Let me try
and find some quiet place where we can be alone
and think.  I am glad we have been forced to sever
all artificial connection with our fellow-men.  Bless
Aunt B.!  We have enough money to go where we
please, and when I have chosen a refuge where we
can be, figuratively, apart in the desert, when we
have had time to forget the harsh inharmonies of
the past weeks; when there is no need any longer
for us to live under the shadow of a lie, then I will
promise you to approach the whole question with an
open mind; to make sure that my sense of values
is rightly adjusted.  And there we can decide, at
rest in one another's trust, which of us two in these
visionary matters, as you describe them, is finally
to follow and which to lead."
</p>

<p>
Before he could answer John walked into the room;
the broad-brimmed cow-boy hat which he usually
wore for shade, pressed flat against the back of his
head like a plate.  The Burman boy, who accompanied
him daily on his afternoon jaunts, silently
disappeared as he caught sight of the master and
mistress.
</p>

<p>
"How funny you look, John," said Ferlie.  "Pull
your hat on properly if you are going out."
</p>

<p>
But John demurred.
</p>

<p>
"The Lord Jesus wears his topee like this," he
informed them pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
And, "O crumbs!" exclaimed Cyprian collapsing.
"Yet another Infant Samuel!"
</p>

<p>
But his amusement was short-lived.  John had a
grievance and had come to report it.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," he said, "there was one tea-party
in the Gardens and nobody didn't let me go to it."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean, darling?"
</p>

<p>
"It was Jimbo's birthday this day.  And I tooked
him the red coal-truck what Po Sein did make me
to-morrow.  And I saw's Jimbo going to the party
and his nurse saw'd me and didn't stop, and Jimbo
runned back an' she was werry angry.  An' he
said he could not take the truck, 'cos his mother
said he wasn't not to play with me any more.  An'
he said Derrick's mother said he wasn't not to play
with me neither, an' then his nurse comed up and
told Po Sein we couldn't come up that road 'cos it
was Mrs. Grey's party and Jimbo must go away at
once."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie turned to look blankly at Cyprian.  The
sins of the fathers...
</p>

<p>
For the first time in her life he swore thoroughly
and completely in her presence, and without
apologizing.  Then he pushed back his chair and
swung John up on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"We have no time to think of parties now, you
and I.  Don't you know that we are going away
in the train?  And I do believe you've not packed
a thing."
</p>

<p>
But when the pair of them had vanished down the
verandah, shouting, Ferlie knelt down beside the
baby on the floor whence it was surveying her with
the puzzled concentrated gaze of the man she worshipped.
</p>

<p>
"Little thing, forgive them!" she whispered.
"They, who know not what they do...."
</p>

<p>
As soon as it was possible the four of them, and
Po Sein, boarded the evening express for Rangoon,
and the house on the hill with the frangipani trees
stood forlornly empty for quite a long time.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
They had decided to account for themselves
verbally and not attempt the written word.
Accordingly, they arrived, unwelcomed, to take up their
quarters in the hotel, and it was agreed that Ferlie
should send for Peter, while Cyprian sought an
interview with Maddock.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, the exact opposite transpired.  Peter,
wearing a Head-of-the-Family air, presented himself
before Cyprian with "my sister" possessively
decorating his lips, and Ferlie ran the old Colonel,
accidentally, to earth on the yacht, in the meantime.
</p>

<p>
Just as well, perhaps; for, while Cyprian was
quite equal to Peter's lofty dutifulness, Ferlie
was much more likely to prove a match for the
Colonel.
</p>

<p>
He had known her all her life but they had not
met since her marriage.  She did not mean to make
a Father-Confessor of him, but his mellowness invited
confidence.  He had outlived all passionate visions
of altering his neighbours' landmarks and had
developed, instead, a distinct sense of humour.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie imagined Peter to be lacking a little in that
commodity.
</p>

<p>
"Well, young woman!" was the Colonel's
greeting as he unbashfully embraced her.  "So you
are playing truant and, likewise, leading the future
Lord John Greville-Mainwaring astray from his
ancient heritage.  Are any of us to be enlisted as
peace-makers?"
</p>

<p>
"Peace is my present objective," said Ferlie,
"but I do not anticipate that Black Towers will
supply it, Uncle Ricky, even at your invitation."
</p>

<p>
"What's the trouble, Duckie?  I've given up
trying to fit square pegs into round holes at my time
of life.  I'm a lonely old man and the secrets of a
pretty girl would just about rejuvenate me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you're nice and old," she agreed pathetically;
"it's the young who are so cruel."
</p>

<p>
"The young!  Well, I'm...  And who has
been accusing you of dyeing that burning bingled
bush?  Show me the woman, for it was never no
lady!"
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Ricky!  You've asked Cyprian, John
and me to join you.  There'll be a Fourth Child
too if we come.  Will you be quite serious and listen
to me for at least a quarter of an hour?"
</p>

<p>
He noted the tired shadows under her eyes and
drew her arm through his.
</p>

<p>
"You come into my cubby-hole," he commanded.
</p>

<p>
He heard her out over American iced drinks with
fruit floating in them.  He was sane and
sea-bronzed and unexclamatory.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, m'dear," he told her in the end,
"the position would just about have killed your
poor mother."
</p>

<p>
"I can't help being glad that I have been spared
the hopeless task of trying to make darling Mother
understand, this side of her tombstone," owned
Ferlie.  "But I've always been sure that if Father
had not been so ill, he would have positively
forbidden me to marry that particular Catch of the
Season."
</p>

<p>
"Ill or well, he never knew, any more than the
rest of us, that you cared for&mdash;anyone else," he
reminded her.
</p>

<p>
"That was because Anyone Else wouldn't admit
that he cared for me&mdash;no, not even to himself.  And
I couldn't force him to, though I did try.  I knew
we 'belonged.'  But there was Peter and Mother
and Margery Craven and Lady Cardew and everyone
sighing over my hesitation, and at last it seemed
the only thing to do to yield.  Right up to the
Wedding Voluntary I wondered if, perhaps, Cyprian
might not rouse up and rescue me.  But he only
sent me a golden apple, and not a line with it!  I
began to believe that I'd mistaken what I knew was
the truth about Cyprian and me."
</p>

<p>
He leant forward and patted her hand.
</p>

<p>
"What's finished is finished.  The question now is
to find the shortest cut to regularizing the affair.
Divorce?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm a Catholic, you know."
</p>

<p>
"So?  Most short-sighted of you.  I thought it
was just another dish Peter wanted to taste.  But he,
too, is going to set up a row of names, like ninepins,
for me to knock down.  Rude names that suit
Biblical Royalty but not the sort of people one knows.
Tut! tut!  You were always a complicated couple.
What of our self-restrained hero?"
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian?  He&mdash;he is against divorce on principle,
but..."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so!  Quite so!  Circumstances over which
he has no control!  By Gad, I'd take that line myself
if you were the woman in the case!"
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Ricky!  You've been a Christopher
Columbus all your life.  Don't you know one spot
on this troublesome earth where Cyprian and I
could have a peaceful holiday with the babies?
He's had to retire, and without work and nowhere to
go&mdash;Oh, don't you see we can't come to any conclusion
while we are occupying the situation of living
targets to Society's very natural curiosity?"
</p>

<p>
"Where on earth do you suppose you'd like to be?"
</p>

<p>
"Somewhere with sea and sands and open sky
and trees and warmth and loveliness and ..."
</p>

<p>
"Here, Ferlie!  Put the brake on.  You want
a tropical island, fully supplied with everything
but worry."
</p>

<p>
She jumped at that.
</p>

<p>
"An island!  Yes.  You are going to the
Andamans.  What are they like?"
</p>

<p>
"Populated where habitable, alas!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't tease.  There must be an odd one among
the number, where we might picnic."
</p>

<p>
"Under what flag?  I mean, with what suitable
excuse?  You'd be hunted up and fêted and asked
to Government House....  No, but let me think."
</p>

<p>
When he next raised his head she saw a solution
had struck him.
</p>

<p>
"It's a daft scheme enough," he muttered.  "But
you are just a pair of lunatics at present, so here goes."
</p>

<p>
He pulled open a drawer and unrolled a couple of
maps, selecting one to push towards her.
</p>

<p>
"These are the Nicobars; the nearest of 'em is
twenty-four hours' journey from Port Blair of the
Andamans.  The Nicobarese are a totally different
race from the Andamanese aboriginals, and a solitary
missionary lives among them obeying the letter of
the Christian Law with more spiritual optimism
than horse-sense.
</p>

<p>
A ship takes his mails from Port Blair every three
months, and, once a year, the Chief Commissioner
inspects the tin church on bamboos, the dozen beehive
huts and the wooden shanty which constitutes the
Settlement of Car Nicobar.  The missionary has a
luxurious wooden house of three or four rooms and
a verandah.
</p>

<p>
He has to flavour his diet with quinine, and so
will you if you join him.  Mind, I don't advocate it,
I'm merely putting it to you that, as I know him,
I can run down there&mdash;it won't alter our course
enough to matter&mdash;and introduce you as friends of
mine who&mdash;well, desire to study the flora and fauna
of the islands!
</p>

<p>
He'll offer to put you up at the Settlement,
overwhelmed by the prospect of your company,
but of course, if you prefer it, I suppose you can build
yourselves huts, or get the converted sheep of his
fold to build them for you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, huts!" cried Ferlie.  "Of course, huts!"
</p>

<p>
He paused to study her transformed face.
</p>

<p>
"Bless my soul!" said the Colonel.  "And I
half expected to be dismissed as an old fool for my
pains!"
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Cyprian and Peter interrupted them making
detailed lists of stores and physic.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian had been finding Peter a little difficult;
Peter had been finding Cyprian, to use his own
desperate expression, "as little open to reason as
Balaam's donkey."
</p>

<p>
"Which saw the guiding angel and was prepared
to follow it, while Balaam was only likely to bump
his nose against a tree," said Cyprian.  And then
resorted to brutality.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think it in the best of taste to criticize
Ferlie and myself when our destiny has been
completely blasted in order that yours might flourish?"
he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"What are you getting at?  Ferlie is a Catholic."
</p>

<p>
"Driven to become one by a marriage to which she
was driven by necessity for money.  Has it never
struck you that Ferlie and I meant a great deal to
one another before Greville-Mainwaring appeared
upon her horizon&mdash;and her family's?"
</p>

<p>
Peter looked blank.
</p>

<p>
"The little idiot never said so!"
</p>

<p>
"No.  She did not consider herself at all, Peter."
</p>

<p>
"All the same, that being true, you gave her up
to him pretty coolly, if I remember rightly.  Even
Mother remarked that you seemed to have lost
interest in Ferlie."
</p>

<p>
"I was cowardly enough to leave that particular
decision to Ferlie," admitted Cyprian.  "I bear my
share of all now.  But I hardly see where you come
in."
</p>

<p>
"What you've told me certainly rather slams
the door in my face.  I thought Ferlie had cut loose
simply because Clifford was impossible; not because
you were the only possible dispenser of her happiness.
But as to Clifford&mdash;have you heard anything about
my hypnotic experiments?"
</p>

<p>
"I know the line you've taken up.  It must be
hellish work."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that's the best way to describe dragging
folks out of hell," said Peter.  "It's not always
their own fault that they are there, you know.  To
my way of thinking, unfortunate products, like
Clifford, and the Vane woman, are less worthy
of censure than you with your Burmese kid."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian made no reply to this.  His close-lipped
control appealed to Peter as could have neither
anger nor attempted self-justification.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," he added, "you're a damned good
fellow, Cyprian, and you'll be relieved to hear that
I'm not going to shove my oar in any more.  As
Ferlie's only brother I considered I had no choice
but to tackle you.  It's a rotten business, and I am
more sorry than I can say for you both; but, after
all, I'm not Ferlie's confessor."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, old chap," said Cyprian.
</p>

<p>
So Peter, though tempted to facetiousness, was
inclined to be encouraging about the island.
</p>

<p>
"We could leave them the small motor-boat,"
he suggested to Maddock.  "We never use it,
Uncle Rick."
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie has wheedled more than half the contents
of the yacht out of me already," grumbled the
Colonel, who was immensely in his element as the
only genuine man-of-the-world in the party
untrammelled by Creed or Convention.  "Look round
my cabin, Sterne; mark down what suits you.
Don't mind me."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder," said Peter, "when we call to fetch
them, three months hence, before the monsoon
sets in, whether they'll be tattooed all over and
chastely clothed in the Nicobarese Sunday gear of
half a coco-nut and an old top-hat?"
</p>

<p>
Thus, by a maintained flow of chaff, the sense of
incipient strain in the atmosphere was dispelled.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian regarded Ferlie ruefully when she first
broke the news.
</p>

<p>
"And you really want to disappear into this
incomparably rural retreat?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think it's a perfect plan?  We shall,
at least, have time to breathe."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there'll be plenty of time&mdash;for everything,"
he agreed.
</p>

<p>
One matter troubled the Colonel.
</p>

<p>
"It'll have to be as Mr. and Mrs. Sterne, you know,
Ferlie.  Not that that little Jellybrand is of a
suspicious nature&mdash;they won't want a passport from
him, hereafter, to prove that of such is the Kingdom
of Heaven.  But, hang it all, I'm standing sponsor
for you, and I desire to take my undeservedly
unblemished reputation to the grave.  And you and
Cyprian don't look at one another with either a
brotherly or a sisterly regard.  Best make it 'Ferlie
Sterne,' and no questions asked."
</p>

<p>
"As if it were necessary for me to wear Cyprian's
hat to indicate that I have belonged to him since the
world began," stormed Ferlie.  "All this bother
comes from Civilization's idiotic habit of changing
a woman's name.  I am just 'Ferlie Marguerite'
in this Evolution, and that's all about it.  I'd rather
be 'Ferlie Cyprian' than 'Sterne'; which is only
half his name, because it certainly wasn't his
mother's."
</p>

<p>
But Uncle Ricky was not going to be drawn into
any more Ferlie-esque controversy.
</p>

<p>
"In whatever capacity you belonged to Cyprian
twelve thousand years ago," he said, "and in
whatever capacity you intend to belong to him when
there is no more marrying and giving in marriage,
you're landing on Car Nicobar as his lawful, or
unlawful, wife."

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
</h3>

<p>
Robinson Crusoe had had, as yet, little time to do
more than leave his footprints on the stretch of
white sand sliding into the summer seas of Car
Nicobar, and the tide washed those out very quickly.
Wilder, lovelier, more brilliant were these islands
than the Andamans, while the Andamanese and the
Nicobarese proved to be separate races indeed,
having no connection with one another.
</p>

<p>
Their very huts and canoes were secular in design.
The Nicobarese names, marking the different
islands on the map, fascinated Ferlie.  Chowra,
Teressa, Bompoka, Trinkat and Katehal of the
Central Group, and Great and Little Nicobar, with
their satellites, Kondul and Pulo Milo in the south,
varied as to dialect in a language so primitive that,
as the Reverend Gabriel Jellybrand mournfully
complained, there seemed no words to express either
"gratitude" or "forgiveness."  Which abstract
nouns once eliminated from the Christian religion,
his sermons became uphill work.
</p>

<p>
For some years he had toiled in seclusion among
this semi-civilized yellowish flock, of whom it was
said that, until Christianity came to their territory,
never one had been known to steal or lie.
</p>

<p>
Originally acknowledged to be of Indo-Chinese
extraction, they were Malayan-Mongolian in type;
often above average height, well-made, simple,
lazy and cowardly, but very good-natured and polite
to strangers.
</p>

<p>
This, then, was the people among whom Ferlie
and Cyprian came, with their respective sons, to
reflect upon the sequel to Eden's story and decide
what parts they would play in it themselves.
</p>

<p>
Gabriel Jellybrand accepted their arrival as a
direct answer to prayer, for he had been sick of a
fever lately and very lonely.  His weak green eyes,
rounded like marbles behind an enormous pair of
sun-glasses, protruded so unusually that Ferlie
expected them to pop out and hit her when she made
clear her ambition to choose the quietest corner of
the quietest island and erect a row of Nicobarese
huts.
</p>

<p>
The padre invariably fought a losing battle with
the letter "w."
</p>

<p>
"But there is no need to do that," he persisted.
"The little bungalow w-which the forest officer
uses on inspection is standing empty.  There w-won't
be enough beds, but if you say you've brought
hammocks&mdash;a most original idea!"
</p>

<p>
He led the way to the Settlement, clad in a cotton
cassock, tied round with a black cord which swung
out and scourged anybody who ventured too near
him when he held up the garment to leap from rock
to rock, revealing an expanse of white cotton sock
below a short tussore trouser-leg.
</p>

<p>
From time to time he would lose his topee, and
then a faithful bodyguard of Baptismal Candidates,
palpably prepared for total immersion at any moment,
would hasten to hand him a large khaki umbrella,
lined with green, which they took it by turns to
carry again after the topee had been recovered
from the puddle or overhanging branch which had
claimed it.
</p>

<p>
"You might have warned us that he was a Comic
Turn," Cyprian told Haddock reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"Describe him to me again at our next meeting,"
said the Colonel, for whom Jellybrand betrayed a
pathetically guileless admiration.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Ricky has always had a number of the
queerest friends," Ferlie whispered.  "Generally
they are lame dogs who would have perished in
some one of the world's ditches but for him.  This
one, at any rate, seems too nearly an imbecile to
take any interest in the obstruse riddles of our
existence."
</p>

<p>
The jungle road, strewn with bamboo leaves,
twisted them out on to a cleared space among the
coco-nut trees, where a tiny church, which would
have lost itself in an ordinary-sized drawing-room,
stood on stilts, as indeed, did everything in the form
of a building, so that, to reach the platforms on which
they were built, it was necessary to run up a short
step-ladder.
</p>

<p>
The interior of the church was fraught with the
pathos of primitive endeavour.  There was a crucifix,
smothered in fading hibiscus heads; a great many
common candles, some of which were, nakedly,
two shortened corpses stuck one on top of the other
to attain the regulation length; a canopy of bamboo
and coloured paper, enshrining a Madonna with a
broken nose imperfectly mended by means of hot
wax, which gave her a somewhat rakish appearance;
the crudest of moral-enforcing missionary prints;
a framed St. Paul (after whom the building was
named) so literally "in the pink" as to impress one
instantaneously with his possible value in a football
scrum, and&mdash;Oh, lift up your heads!&mdash;a small shiny
harmonium on which the little padre had, in the
course of a year, just learnt to accompany his flock
with one finger, though he had not yet given up hope
of bringing the other nine into requisition somewhen.
For the rest, they relied upon a catechist
with a concertina, who knew seven hymns which he
performed in strict rotation.
</p>

<p>
"But now that you have come..." said Jellybrand,
eyeing Ferlie with eager expectancy.  And
she had not the heart to erect a barrier of doctrinal
differences, for her protection, between his hungry
enthusiasm and the harmonium stool.
</p>

<p>
"I see you have started a shop," said Colonel
Maddock emerging from a thatched fastness, wherein
lay heaped up some yards of calico, red flannel, a few
tin pots and pans, coloured prints, packets of tea,
pounds of sugar and several bright glass necklaces.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear me, yes.  W-would you believe it?
Mr. Pell, here&mdash;w-where are you, Mr. Pell?&mdash;a most
unselfish person, w-who always acts on the excellent
principle that it is more blessed to give than to receive,
w-was left in charge of the shop w-when I w-was
over at Nankauri, visiting.  And&mdash;w-would you
believe it?&mdash;he gave every single thing away w-without
taking any coco-nuts in payment!  Of course,
the people are ready now to let the Government
start any number of shops...."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pell, hitching up the nether garments which
were the outward and visible sign of his inward state
of grace, beamed urbanely upon the newcomers.
</p>

<p>
"This," said Jellybrand, indicating a gentleman
with a string of cowrie shells about his middle and
a battered English straw upon his head, "is
Friend-of-England, the chief of the village.  He is not yet
a member of my little community though he w-wishes
us w-well, I am sure.
</p>

<p>
"A long w-while ago, he had forty devils extracted
from him by the menluana, or w-witch doctors,
and it is hardly surprising that, under their
conscientious exorcism, he nearly died.  All the men in
the village sat round him in a circle and on anyone's
perceiving a devil he pounced on it, w-wrapped it
in a leaf, and put it in the corner of the house.
</p>

<p>
"Every year, the Chief Commissioner, w-when he
inspects us from Port Blair, presents him w-with a
suit of clothes in virtue of his position; but he
reserves them for festivals and always puts them
away w-when it rains.
</p>

<p>
"The two beside him are Mr. Corney Grain and
Mr. Don Juan.  The traders coming to the islands
give them those names in fun, but I hope to baptize
them soon and then they w-will be Peter and Paul&mdash;much
more suitable."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie wondered why.
</p>

<p>
A man with enormous calves supporting a very
small body approached the speaker confidentially
and, presently, Jellybrand interpreted.
</p>

<p>
"This is James Snook.  He and Friend-of-England
have both, as you see, got elephantiasis.
A lot of them suffer from it&mdash;most unfortunate.
He w-wishes to show you his new house."
</p>

<p>
Encouraged to proceed, James waved the party
towards a thatched beehive supported on four rickety
poles, seeming not to possess, at first sight,
either door or window.  However, a ladder
discovered underneath the contraption vanished into a
yawning hole, and Cyprian and Ferlie braved this
first, to fall gasping on to a palm-plaited floor
which bounded like a spring mattress beneath
them.  They could not stand upright and there was
a thick warmth of atmosphere and almost total
darkness until Mr. Snook removed a loose lump of
thatch from the wall.
</p>

<p>
In one corner of the room lay his cooking utensils
opposite the rag bundle on which he slept nightly,
after blocking out all oxygen.
</p>

<p>
The walls were covered with works of art cut
from any ancient illustrated paper which had happened
to fall into his hands from the padre's stock.
They were hung, for the most part, upside down,
and thus Pavlova waved mocking legs at a Mission
print of Christ crucified, into the Figure of which
the enlightened James had brilliantly bethought
himself to hammer real nails.
</p>

<p>
Above, glared a garish painting on talc of a Hindu
deity with six arms.
</p>

<p>
Truly, Gabriel Jellybrand stood in need of that
optimism which accompanies the faith of all Heaven's
"little children."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The steam-yacht pushed off again with the evening
tide, leaving Cyprian and Ferlie wandering back
from the shore, the coco-nut trees chattering above
their heads in the falling breeze.  Occasionally
she picked up Thu Daw whose legs were not, as yet,
quite to be trusted, and would carry him away to the
left or to the right, down slight inclines into some
cave of dark foliage.
</p>

<p>
"And is this Heaven?" asked John, following out
some private train of thought connected with Jellybrand
and the concertina, the owner of which could
be heard practising in the distance.
</p>

<p>
"'Over the fields of glory,' you know, Mother,
and 'over the jasper sea'!"
</p>

<p>
"Not that Heaven, yet," said Ferlie.  "This is
more like the Garden of Paradise in your Hans
Andersen."
</p>

<p>
"I sometimes wish," said Cyprian, "that you
and John were not so inordinately well read."
</p>

<p>
"Anyway," finished John, after a thoughtful
pause, "will I be let sleep in one of them kennels
to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"There!  He has said it."  Cyprian rounded
on Ferlie.  "I trust, Ferlie, you are going to permit
us the unromantic shelter of the forest bungalow,
but I have not really any hope.  Of course, if John
honestly finds it coincides with his conception of the
Simple Life to share the couch of James Snook&mdash;but
I noticed several holes in the roof of the bungalow
which should give primitive colour to the place for
our satisfaction and more holes in the floor, which
intuition tells me represent the overcrowded tenement
lodgings of considerable families of snakes and rats."
</p>

<p>
"Firstly," said Ferlie, "you are sleeping out of
doors.  We will sling our hammocks between trees,
under the mosquito nets.  Secondly, John, you are
not so much as to enter a kennel without leave.
I don't know whether that elephantiasis is catching.
Thirdly, an educated man's intuition should assure
him that snakes and rats seldom dwell together in
sunny amity."
</p>

<p>
"Scorpions, then," insisted Cyprian gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"Fourthly, a perforated roof cannot affect us
until the Rains, and there will be ample time before
they break, should we still be here, for you to have
constructed us a model mansion with hot and cold
water laid on and clematis and cabbages before and
behind respectively....  Do I hear the sweet
chiming of the village bells?"
</p>

<p>
"You do," replied Cyprian.  "And, if I mistake
not, shortly they will be drowned by the pious fervour
of the village choir."
</p>

<p>
When they emerged at the clearing the bell was,
indeed, ringing to Evensong.
</p>

<p>
Jellybrand had added a voluminous surplice and
a limp stole to his attire, but had raptly removed his
white canvas shoes instead of his topee, in
absent-minded imitation of his parishioners.
</p>

<p>
A procession was forming outside the church led
by Mr. Pell in the capacity of cross-bearer; in fact,
it was Mr. Pell's top-hat that caused the padre to
recollect that he was being reverent the wrong end
for the colour of his skin, before the red-breeched
row of boys proceeded to "survey the wondrous
cross" in the highest key of which the concertina
was capable.
</p>

<p>
The Unsaved of the village were cutting bamboo
decorations, in the background, for a moonlight
festival about to be held with the object of securing a
mate for a lonely demon, who had been bringing bad
luck to the community and was expected to depart
in peace as soon as a she-demon could be found to
share his flitting.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie and Cyprian stood some way apart from the
two groups of worshippers while the crimson
sunlight streamed across the stems of the coco-nut
palms, and stained the uplifted cross as its followers
passed, two by two, into the toy church and the last
notes of the hymn thinned into silence.
</p>

<p>
The words were dragged out painfully by the child-voices
singing in a strange tongue of a strange story,
brought to them by strangers from another land.
</p>

<p>
  "His dying crimson like a robe,<br>
  Spread o'er His Body on the Tree;<br>
  Then am I dead to all the globe,<br>
  And all the globe is dead to me."<br>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Ferlie left Cyprian among the lengthening shadows
and, herself, moved slowly across the sunlit space,
and so up the wooden steps, into the tiny forlorn
mansion of God.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
By the time they had decided to settle the bungalow
as their headquarters, and making expeditions in
the motor-boat to the neighbouring islands whenever
they desired complete isolation, Cyprian, whose
instincts for research had awakened with the
cessation of his ordinary work, brought Ferlie an oddly
carved board covered with paintings and punctured
sketches.
</p>

<p>
"The padre calls these Henta.  They are samples
of the form in which the Nicobarese preserve their
legends, and I ask you to look at the tangled thread
of Christianity running through the whole.  Jellybrand
has been explaining.  The first man offended
the Chief of the Spirits at the instigation of the first
woman.  The Spirit's name, Deuse, savours of the
mission teaching by your Church.  Here, you see
Deuse, in arresting <i>négligé</i>, surrounded by his
cooking-pots, and below him huts, trees, birds and
dancing figures.  Also mermaids and mermen,
because dugongs and whales are indigenous to
these waters.  The Henta are made to please the
iwi-ka, or good spirits, and to alarm iwi-pot or
demons."
</p>

<p>
"You are an inquisitive soul, Cyprian.  Are you
hitting at the Missions, or what?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Except that, but for them, in this Eden
we should have been able to escape the story of the
Fall.  Apart from that teaching, the people believe
their origin dates from the time a shipwrecked sailor
was cast up on these shores with a pet dog.  By
her he had a son whom she concealed in her leaf
petticoat, or ngong, and this son, on attaining
years of discretion, slew his father and married
his mother to continue the race.
</p>

<p>
"Therefore, the young men wear a bow of coco-nut
leaves on their foreheads, representing the ears of
the dog-ancestor, and all dogs are well treated in
her honour."
</p>

<p>
"And poor little Jellybrand is trying to replace
their allegories with ours?  The one they will really
appreciate will be Jonah and the whale."
</p>

<p>
"The most ridiculous part of it all to me is the
way that each race, temporarily in power here, has
striven to produce a different form of Christianity.
Think of the waste labour since 1756, after the
Danish Mission departed and was followed by the
Dutch.  When the Dutch attempt at colonization
failed, the Jesuits and Moravians were inspired to
try their luck till the British took over with Danish
consent in order to try and stop the piracy then
rife in these waters.  But I don't understand Jelly's
line, Ferlie.  He is not a Roman."
</p>

<p>
"In England he would belong to what was once
known as the High Church Party, but now has
developed into Anglo-Catholicism.  I can easily
imagine that his successor will probably have
ultra-Protestant and anti-Catholic notions and solemnly
smash the pink St. Paul and the battered Madonna
which to-day are the pride of the converts."
</p>

<p>
"I think he is an amazing specimen," said Cyprian.
</p>

<p>
"I think he is an amazing duck....  And doesn't
he just remind me of a white rat!"
</p>

<p>
"Mother," and John broke in upon Cyprian's
amusement, "I've found a house and they say the
man in it is going to have a baby.  Come and see
how he does it."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie looked at him.
</p>

<p>
"The daily round and common task will furnish
all you need to ask here, I can foresee, my son,"
she told him.
</p>

<p>
"Dare we investigate?" asked Cyprian, when he
had recovered his gravity.  "He may have discovered
something interesting in the way of a rite."
</p>

<p>
He had.  The hut he referred to was, to the
islanders, tabu, or forbidden, since an unfortunate
husband, about to become a father, was imprisoned
within it beside his wife, sharing her troubles by
sympathetic imitation.  He was deprived of the
luxury of a bath and betel-chewing and, for some
while before, he had not been allowed to bind any
objects together nor to attend feasts.  Moreover, a
whole month must elapse, after the child's birth,
before he would be permitted to escape.
</p>

<p>
Friend-of-England, whom they chanced upon in
the vicinity, described the custom in much-broken
English, and Ferlie managed to keep a straight face
while Cyprian examined the texture of coco-nut
leaves and wished, for the time being, that he had
never been born at all, or, at any rate, that nobody
knew how.
</p>

<p>
"Ought John to discover these things?" he asked
Ferlie later; "isn't it spoiling his innocence rather
young?"
</p>

<p>
She laughed at him.  "I should be sorry to think
that you had lost yours in learning of them," she
said.  "Nature did not fall with the Fall.  But so
long as Mankind is content to lie supine, including
all Nature in his own disgrace, so long will the serpent
insinuate horror into the man-made Eden."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose, in due course, you will interpret;
but sometimes I do not know whether to regard you
as a totally unnatural product of Super-civilization
or merely a successful example of the triumph of
mind over matter."
</p>

<p>
He did not know, either, how to read the look she
gave him.
</p>

<p>
"In a little while, my dear," she said, "you will
be able to decide."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The days fled by; long days of lethargic rest.
The children had grown popular with the Mission,
and one lady member in particular had attached
herself to them as a kind of voluntary nurse.  This
left the two Explorers time for longer expeditions
round the islands than they could have taken with
John and Thu Daw.
</p>

<p>
One day they lost themselves in a more impenetrable
part of the forest, where ten yards of experimenting
with paths was sufficient to shut out the
sky and enclose inexperienced travellers in a leafy
tomb.  On escaping from it, stained and breathless,
just as they were beginning to think they had better
make their peace with the invisible heavens,
preparatory to holding it for ever, they nearly fell over
the bank of an unexpected river.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie contemplated it awhile in silence and then
turned deliberately back a little way into the jungle.
</p>

<p>
"You can have that palm tree all to yourself,"
she told Cyprian.
</p>

<p>
But he was still attitudinizing, incomprehensive,
on the bank of the river when she returned in a
somewhat scantily improvised bathing dress.
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie!"
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you ready?"
</p>

<p>
The quiver of amusement in the challenge did it.
He flung back his head and laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  But, oh, Ferlie, you are incorrigible!"
</p>

<p>
She was trailing her feet in the water when he
joined her, forgetful of all problems not directly
connected with the cool green water.
</p>

<p>
"I shall dive off and swim to that log," pointing
to one barely visible near the opposite bank.  "From
there I shall encourage your amateur efforts and
proffer suitable advice."
</p>

<p>
Said Ferlie: "I shall be sitting on the most
comfortable end of the log long before your slow-coach
head has emerged from the weedy depths to be
mistaken for a floating coco-nut by some water-fowl
in search of a raft."
</p>

<p>
But as she slipped into the water, the log on which
they anticipated basking rolled over without rhyme
or reason into deep water.  It splashed lazily
upstream breaking the green jade surface into a million
ripples before, having yawned in their faces with
thoughtful deliberation, it sank gracefully out of
sight.
</p>

<p>
After an instant's smitten silence they collapsed
backwards on the soft mud above the bank, sobbing
with relieved merriment.
</p>

<p>
"Which is the most comfortable end of him?"
gasped Cyprian.
</p>

<p>
Cheated of their swim, they threw themselves
on to higher ground and stretched full length along
the warm grass.
</p>

<p>
She was wet to her arm-pits and Digby Maur
might have long sought a more suitable subject
for a River Nat.
</p>

<p>
The sense of comfort and physical well-being, as
he lay sunning himself, occupied Cyprian too
completely for his attention to rivet itself at once upon
the near intimacy of her, outlined on an emerald
shield, defenceless in her slim fairness against his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Idly tossing twigs into the stream, one missed its
mark and alighted on her bare shoulder.
</p>

<p>
She smiled in absent acknowledgment, but her
gaze remained fixed upon the shifting reflections
ahead.
</p>

<p>
He studied her then, with sleepy interest and, by
the subconscious link between them, was aware
that she knew his attitude of mind to be both puzzled
and interrogative.  He gathered that something was
busily revolving in her brain which she would not
yet disclose.
</p>

<p>
And as the leaves above them made changing
patterns upon his own rapidly browning limbs,
he forgot the scantiness of his attire and this outright
defiance of all safeguarding law which stood
between him and the whip of that Master Force from
whose dominion she had despairingly wondered
whether Mankind would ever be free.
</p>

<p>
Once-known sentences in Greek intruded, word
by word, upon his brain, till the whole resolved
itself into a fragment from Plato's immortal Republic
preserved fresh, since, on the earlier waxen tablets
of the mind, impressions remain cut singly and deep,
though neglected for long periods in the crowded
years which follow:
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-235"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-235.jpg" alt="Greek text">
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He saw himself again, an angular youth still in
the magic teens, wrestling studiously with the
paragraph; his sympathies completely with Thrasymachus
of Chalcedon and his subsequent bull-like
attack upon Polemarchus and Socrates, when,
"playing the fool together in mutual complaisance,"
they had expanded the drivellings of old Cephalus
concerning the abatement of his appetites into an
interminable and exceedingly toilsome-to-translate
discussion on the nature of Justice.
</p>

<p>
Words, words, words, thought Cyprian, now as
then.  The ancient writers of all nations might
philosophize and analyse and theorize through
pages of intellectual war, but still Justice struggled
to dwell upon this globe, and still the Frantic Master
scourged men on to deeds which drove her out.
With what object?  The perpetual propagation
of a mortal race, apparently doomed (while the
chemical atoms of mud and water to which they
clung, held together) to blind burrowings for some
Philosopher's Stone upon which might be engraved
the key to their existence.
</p>

<p>
Always that awareness, stifling their half-developed
senses, of bodily decay and rotting death, mental
and physical, till the spirit cried out like a terrified
child in the imprisonment of a gradually enveloping
Darkness.
</p>

<p>
Was it wonderful if the mind strove to drug
realization of the conditions under which it existed
by resorting to fruitless accumulation of metal and
mummified matter, materially precious only because
so far as Man knew, there was not enough of it to
go round?  Was it wonderful if, wearying of this
empty labour, he passed from the opium dreams of
wealth to the cocaine illusions of power over his
fellows, or acted yet another part, inebriate with
meditation upon a solitary mountain top, or grovelled
in a secret cave, denying access to any who might
wish to awaken him from dreams to cold reality
once more?
</p>

<p>
Was not the ascetic, hugging and hoarding his
visions, as useless a product as the miser hugging
and hoarding his gold?&mdash;and the mystic, luxuriating
in a religious mirage, as much a glutton for prayer
as his Epicurean neighbour might prove himself a
glutton for pleasure?
</p>

<p>
What did he, himself, desire of the gods that be,
asked Cyprian.  Ferlie?  And of Ferlie, what?
Her white limbs entwined in his, ever and anon,
throughout the years, in the thirsting hope that much
yielding to a fitful and passing emotion would so
unite him with her Being that nothing could separate
them again?...
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "For sudden ... a peace out of pain...<br>
  Then a light, then thy breast,<br>
  Oh, thou, soul of my soul!  I shall clasp thee again,<br>
  And with God be the rest!"<br>
</p>

<p>
Not this way lay the road to that satisfied unity.
And she knew it.  God, yes!  How terribly well
she must know it!  He, in Thu Daw, she, in John,
had yielded to the Earth that heritage it demanded
of all living creatures which crawled upon its face.
They had added their quota to Creation, lest Life
perish here before its incomprehensible purpose
should have been fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
Was another life required of them to perfect the
love they bore one another?  All life is by no means
conceived in love.  Did not that which was weigh
more precious in the scales of Eternity than any
conceived in duty to the natural law of a source
called "God"?  And yet ... out here, where one
could almost listen to the pulses of Nature beating,
unregulated and unquickened by the fevers which dull
the senses of Earth's normal sons and daughters,
how had these barriers melted which the crowded
places interposed between his Self and Hers?
What law but the natural one was good in the eyes
of Nature's Creator?
</p>

<p>
And Nature bade him reach out to her his starving
arms.  He stirred among the shrivelling strands of
fibre, strewing the turf, and sat up, clasping his hands
about his knees.
</p>

<p>
Still she did not look at him, and savagely he tore
in imagination at the filmy veil barring him out of
her dreams.
</p>

<p>
But she spoke, dispassionately as an oracle, from
her strongly splendid aloofness.
</p>

<p>
"Think it out a little further, Cyprian, before
you decide."
</p>

<p>
He felt the Master's lash about his body; and was
stung by it to sharpened understanding.
</p>

<p>
Deliberately and fearlessly, Ferlie was challenging
his faith.  By it she would rise or fall.
</p>

<p>
If it drove him along that path of desire which
led but to the grave, she would follow because her
own will was pledged to his, "through all the
beauty and all the loving of the eternal years...."  She
did not believe that this momentary impulse
was grounded in his faith.
</p>

<p>
He saw, as in a drowning panorama, all the forms
of all the acknowledged great lovers who had staked
their gift of life upon Desire and, with the fading
of that frail rainbow thing, had discovered themselves
upon the edge of the burnt-out desert, Age, beyond
which flowed only the bitterly black waters of Death.
With the inexorable tread of the years Ferlie
and he would be dying slowly before one another's
watching eyes.  The end must come in sweating
battle with the impotency of those same bodies,
glowing now in the deceiving radiance of a sun
which would, some day, itself be darkened.  Of
what avail then the agonizing vows, sealed lip to lip
in the sheltering purple shadows of dead nights
whose beauty was now a scorching memory to
contrast with the starless darkness of the opening
tomb?  (Ferlie had always been able to visualize
that tomb.)  There must be some other fulfilment
for the love which has kept watch o'er its
immortality.  Some other road than this, along which
the faithless "Little Ones" had stumbled with
bleeding feet down the revealing arches of the years....
One was risking all for a shadow....  But as one
saw the shadow it was that of a very mighty reality....
Behind every shadow there must be a substance.
Ferlie had decided that herself ... already.  In
this, it was, fairly, hers to lead.
</p>

<p>
"Lead on," echoed Cyprian aloud of his heart,
remembering when she had used the selfsame
words to him.
</p>

<p>
She put out, to touch his, a hand still cool and
damp with undried crystals of moisture.
</p>

<p>
"It is extraordinary to remember," she said,
"that the crocodile had probably never set eyes
on a human being before.  There is, practically,
no animal life in these forests, so Jelly told me,
except pigs and birds.  In the interior there are
rumours of bison and, of course, the hamadryad
we have always with us."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, your Garden of Paradise is certainly not
serpentless," Cyprian answered, a note of amusement
now in his voice.
</p>

<p>
She got up and shook the clinging twigs from her
hair.
</p>

<p>
"I am dry.  I must go and dress.  The one thing
which calms my fear of serpents is a discovery that
if you keep still when they are about, and leave
them alone, they invariably leave you alone."

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
</h3>

<p>
On returning home, they passed close to their own
village which seemed unusually noisy.
</p>

<p>
Half-way across the Settlement John came to
meet them in charge of Naomi, the shining light
among Jellybrand's converts.  John was armed
to the teeth, a shaped coco-nut husk upon his head
and a wooden spear in his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," he called out, on sighting them,
"there was a deaded man took out of one kennel,
only they have tooken him away to Heaven now and
everybody are very angry about it."
</p>

<p>
"You appear to have been seeing life during our
absence, John," said Cyprian, as Ferlie questioned
Naomi.
</p>

<p>
"One man make himself dead," that lady explained
pleasantly.  "'Nother village angry with
his family."
</p>

<p>
The Settlement, when they reached it, appeared
also, to be on the defensive.  Little Jellybrand,
bustling about with a shot-gun, which Cyprian
instinctively recognized as a more dangerous weapon
to its owner than to anything he aimed it at,
explained that James Snook had, indeed, hanged
himself from one of the stilts of his hut, having had
trouble of some sort with his family while not in
particularly good health.  One of his sons had, lately,
caught an evil spirit and launched it triumphantly
on the deep in a small model canoe.  The canoe
landed its invisible occupant near the hut of an
enemy's village and, hence, these furious
preparations to meet a revengeful raid.
</p>

<p>
Three members of the Mission village's aristocracy,
Scarecrow, Kingfisher and Captain Johnson,
one of whom wore a bowler hat, green with age,
and another, a child's tam-o'-shanter, legacies both
of passing traders, had painted their faces scarlet
and prepared quarter-staves dipped in pig's blood.
Helmets of coco-nut husk were being rapidly
distributed.
</p>

<p>
"W-we have these troubles periodically, w-would
you believe it?" said Jellybrand.  "There is no
cause for alarm, but one has to show that the Mission
is quite able to defend itself, should the raiders come
on here.  I am shutting up all my children in the
Mission School and shall patrol outside it to-night
w-with a loaded weapon."
</p>

<p>
He waved his gun valiantly at Cyprian and then
let it off accidentally within a yard of Friend-of-England,
who despite his elephantiasis, leapt lightly
into the air.
</p>

<p>
"That ought to teach them to keep away from a
loaded gun," the Defender of the Young remarked
placidly, having ascertained that no one had
received a pellet in the back.
</p>

<p>
"Young Brown has been detailed off to parade
your house to-night, Mr. Sterne, and he will rouse
you if your assistance is required."
</p>

<p>
Young Brown, a veteran of sixty, roused nothing
but Cyprian's bitter enmity by the tumult of his
snoring outside the bathroom door.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, the quarrel petered out in the village,
where there was enough noise to attract every ghost
in the cemetery, and as one party was getting the
worst of a species of warfare worthy of Tweedledum
and Tweedledee, the women interfered and separated
the combatants with dahs.  Whereupon, all broken
fingers were displayed and bandaged, and the enemy
remained on to feast with the raided party, returning
peacefully homewards after a couple of days.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Toms," the Government agent of doubtful
nationality, made a note in his diary that, "James
Snook, elder and landowner of Car Nicobar, committed
suicide by hanging himself, owing to domestic
troubles with his children, whom his ghost will, no
doubt, exceedingly trouble."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
A few days later, the padre fell upon Ferlie and the
children when they were sunning themselves in a
sand-pit, clad in sea-weed, bathing costumes and
shells.  He, literally, fell upon them sliding down
the soft slope and subsiding gracefully into Ferlie's
lap, hitting Cyprian en route, a swinging blow with
the cord of what the latter called the "wedding
garment."  He asked them if they would care to
drive with him into the interior to view a moonlight
festival that night.  He made the suggestion rather
wistfully as though aware that these twain needed
no outside excitement to keep them interested in
one another.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie, her conscience pricking, tendered him
radiant thanks.  After his departure Cyprian
demurred.
</p>

<p>
"It's a track through the jungle where a Red
Indian would knock his shins every five minutes,
and if the blighter intends driving us out behind
Slippery Sam at night, I prophesy that you will spend
the small hours of the morning sitting in a cactus
hedge and consigning him elsewhere."
</p>

<p>
Slippery Sam, a one-eyed horse, by whose exertions
the padre proudly made his rounds, was nearly
as great a danger to the community as his shot-gun.
</p>

<p>
Jellybrand had bought him, cheap, of a trader
because his one eye, making him nervous, he was
a consistent kicker.
</p>

<p>
However, though there happened to be a brilliant
moon which silvered the palms and blackened their
shadows to thick treacley pools, Slippery Sam, with
Ferlie behind the driver and Cyprian perched on the
back seat of the rocking tonga, appeared that
evening to be in spiritual rather than spirited mood.
</p>

<p>
"He's really a very nice horse," Jellybrand's
mild accents assured them, "and w-would you
believe it?&mdash;he loves ripe coco-nuts."
</p>

<p>
"I saw you picking yours to-day, Padre," said
Ferlie.  "What do you expect to make off your
plantation?"
</p>

<p>
He sighed.  "It's only an experiment of mine.
I am so anxious to have a chancel lamp.  One that
burns perpetually, you know.  My Party is coming
on so at Home.  All the Anglo-Catholic churches
have them, I am told.  It is so unfortunate that I
can only afford a night-light in a glass.  I have
pasted red paper over the glass, as you have probably
noticed.  It isn't altogether impressive as a
substitute, but it pleases the children."
</p>

<p>
"Of whom you are the most childish," thought
Cyprian; but aloud he said, "do you seriously
think that, if your Mission left the natives in peace
for one year, there would be a Christian left in the
islands at the end of that time?"
</p>

<p>
"The Lord is mindful of His own," returned
Jellybrand reproachfully.  "One puts one's trust
in the rising generation.  But the mothers <i>will</i> hide
the children at census times, lest the Government
spirit them away to school!"
</p>

<p>
"Wise women!" muttered Cyprian; but the
speaker, unhearing, went on:
</p>

<p>
"I have had twelve babies born this year and
baptized them all.  Twelve among the Converted!
It is God's will to provide the children."
</p>

<p>
"You can call it that if you like," Cyprian
admitted.  And Ferlie, uncertain that he was going to
behave well throughout the drive, plunged into a
dissertation on sweet potatoes.
</p>

<p>
Another mile and a half and the road became
exciting enough for private prayer.  All at once, a
darksome pit yawning at the feet of Slippery Sam,
he freed himself of his master's mild restraint by a
coolly-timed kick at a vital piece of harness where
he had been led by knowledge of Nicobarese
psychology to expect the feeble co-operation of a bit
of frayed string with his leather shackles, and
proceeded to crop by the wayside.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid we will have to get out," regretted
the padre's dulcet tones.
</p>

<p>
From a hedge that was, luckily, not cactus,
Ferlie succumbed to the retort courteous.
</p>

<p>
"I am out," she said.
</p>

<p>
No word came from Cyprian, and she was just
wondering whether one of them ought not to be
lowered, like Sinbad, into the pit in search of his
mangled bones, when an angry pattering announced
his arrival from the dark behind them.
</p>

<p>
"Why, where did we shed you?" in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Half a mile back," he stormed.  "I howled like
a maniac, but you were engrossed in invoking your
patron saint, and the padre, Slippery Sam."
</p>

<p>
They continued their way on foot down paths
wherein they feared much evil, between patches
of moonlight, bursting brightly enough through the
interlacing branches to have enabled them to read
a letter.
</p>

<p>
Weird sounds guided them to a ring of scantily-clad
revellers round a bonfire and a young lady, attired
in rings of silver wire which crawled up her legs
and arms, impeding free movement.
</p>

<p>
The Chief of the family, who introduced himself as
"Captain Tin Belly," told them that the girl was
<i>mafai</i> or bewitched, and there to be fêted.  She
had been very ill and was inspired by convalescence
to prophesy on the heels of an extraordinary
dream.
</p>

<p>
Thus, also, were witch-doctors licensed, but if the
aspirant to that honour was, later, doomed a failure
he was again relegated to private life.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Toms, who had arrived at the festivities,
proved a useful interpreter.
</p>

<p>
"This lady was cured by English prescription,"
he told Ferlie.  "That which you doubtless use,
when Eno's Salts are added to water with some
turpentine and powdered camphor.  They gave
twice a day for belly-ache."
</p>

<p>
Wild chanting heralded another procession from
a neighbouring village, the members of which
beat a pig-skin drum and bore aloft the corpse of a
sacrificial pig, while indignant squealing from the
rear betrayed the whereabouts of more pigs, bound
for burnt offering.
</p>

<p>
The great dance of the evening was executed
to hand-clapping, accompanied by a low monotone
introducing here and there odd English phrases,
culled from the Converted, in compliment to the
foreigners present.
</p>

<p>
"Where-is-my-hat-safe-in-the-arms-of-Jesus-give-
him-more-pig-God-save-the-King," one man sang
piously in passing Ferlie.
</p>

<p>
"Is Delilah the <i>hors d'œuvre</i> or only the dessert?"
asked Cyprian, watching the hoisting of the Amazon
in silver armour to an honourable situation beside
the dead pig.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Toms announced that she would now heal
people by her touch and the art of shampooing.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty little cannibalism in the islands," he
reassured them cheerfully.  "When discovered in
the past, on Camorta Island, for secret rites, it very
punishable.  The Nicobarese a simple people and
a musical."
</p>

<p>
"One had guessed as much," said Cyprian,
putting his hands to his ears as the chorus grew
deafening.
</p>

<p>
Captain Tin Belly presented them each with a
plaited palm-leaf box from a shrine bristling with
votive bananas.  The boxes were not the same size
and the discovery seemed to worry him; he measured
them several times in the faint expectation that one
would grow in the process.
</p>

<p>
On the way home, with Slippery Sam consistently
practising the double-shuffle, Ferlie asked: "Padre,
do you never grow tired of smiling at them and
appreciating their customs, and settling their
infantile disputes?  Don't you often give up hope?"
</p>

<p>
His pathetic pink-rimmed brown eyes were glorious
with vision as he answered: "I never grow
tired of praying for them; and then one hopes
again."
</p>

<p>
As Cyprian said afterwards to Ferlie, "One can
hypnotise oneself into any state of semi-imbecility
through prayer."
</p>

<p>
He remained restlessly convinced that whether
or no the islands were going to bring him any closer
to Ferlie's visions they were not going to bring him
any closer to her God.
</p>

<p>
Nor to the God of the Reverend Gabriel Jellybrand.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
An incident which occurred during the following
week seemed to confirm that impression.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie never forgot that evening; the last which
spelt peace for them for many a long day.
</p>

<p>
The children had built a camp-fire on the edge
of the jungle; not for warmth, but because it was
a good way to dry the wet things of juvenile
adventurers who had been assisting at fish-spearing or
canoe-racing throughout the day.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Toms and Friend-of-England would often
join them in the murmuring twilight and the elder
folk drew near also, when he and the old Nicobarese
spun little stories and island legends for John's benefit.
</p>

<p>
The favourite, related again on this particular
occasion, was the story of Shoan and the Mermaid.
</p>

<p>
It had, originally, been invented by the traveller,
De Roepstoff, who knew that the cachelot lived in
Nicobarese waters and that, according to the natives,
the mermaid is the whale's daughter.  De Roepstoff,
re-visiting the islands years later, had the tale re-told
him as one of their own.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Toms related it now in English, periodically
assisted by Friend-of-England in Nicobarese.
</p>

<p>
"Come all Nicobarese and foreigners, old and
young, men and women, boys and girls, youths and
maidens, and listen to a story.
</p>

<p>
"There was formerly a man by the name of Arang,
whose wife had borne (him) three sons and three
daughters.  He made himself a nice house and
possessed much property.  One day he went out
on the sea with his eldest son, called Shoan, and
wanted to fish with hook and line.
</p>

<p>
"Strong wind got up and heavy sea sprung up.
Then it happened that one of the outriggers of the
canoe broke and both sank into the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Arang was drowned, but the boy crawled up
on the back of the canoe and cried: "'What
shall I do?  My father is dead; what am I to
do?'
</p>

<p>
"Whish!  It is the whale arriving.
</p>

<p>
"'Why are you crying, child?'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, my father is dead; I cannot survive; how
shall I get home? (lit.: 'there is no road.')  What
am I to do?  My father is dead.'
</p>

<p>
"'Sit down on my back.  I know the road,' said
the whale.
</p>

<p>
"'Oh no, I will not,' said the boy.  'I am afraid.
I do not know the road as my father is dead.'
</p>

<p>
"But after a while Shoan did sit on the back of
the whale.
</p>

<p>
"Whish!  Off they went, quickly, swiftly!  The
whale is the chief of the sea.  At sight all got afraid
of him.
</p>

<p>
"The flying fish flew in all directions; the turtle
dived down suddenly; the shark sank down (below)
his fin; the sea-snake dug himself into the sand;
the ilu danced along the sea; the dugong hugged
her young one; the dolphins fled, for they were
afraid of the whale.
</p>

<p>
"Thus (sped) the two.  By and by, they arrived
at the country of the whale.  It was a big domed
house.  The walls were of red coral, the steps were
made of tridachua.
</p>

<p>
"In the house they saw the daughter of the whale,
whose name was Giri.
</p>

<p>
"'Do you like this boy?' said the whale.
</p>

<p>
"'All right, let him stay,' said Giri.
</p>

<p>
"'Do you like to stay, Shoan?'
</p>

<p>
"'I am willing to stay here.'
</p>

<p>
"Then Shoan became the servant of Giri.
</p>

<p>
"Giri's face was like that of a woman; below
she was shaped like a fish-tail; her breast was the
colour of mother-o'-pearl; her back was like gold;
her eyes were like stars; her hair like seaweed.
</p>

<p>
"She said to Shoan, 'What work do you do?'
</p>

<p>
"'I collect coco-nuts in the jungle.'
</p>

<p>
"'Never mind, we have no coco-nuts, but what
other work can you do?"
</p>

<p>
"'I can make boats.'
</p>

<p>
"'We do not want boats, (but) what other work
do you know?'
</p>

<p>
"'I know how to spear fish.'
</p>

<p>
"'Don't!  You must not do it, (for) we love the
fish.  My father is a chief among the fish.  Never
mind; comb my hair.'
</p>

<p>
"Shoan remained.  He combed her hair.  They
(used) to joke together, and they married.
</p>

<p>
"Said Shoan: 'How is it, wife, that you do not
possess a looking-glass, although your face is so
nice?'
</p>

<p>
"'I want a looking-glass; look out for one.'
</p>

<p>
"'In my parents' house in the village there
is one looking-glass (but) I do not know the
road.'
</p>

<p>
"'Never mind!  I know the road; sit on my
back and I will bring you near the land.  I cannot
walk in your country but do (I pray you) return
quickly.'
</p>

<p>
"Then Shoan returned to the village.  He came
to (lit.: "saw") his father's house.
</p>

<p>
"'Who is there?' said his mother.
</p>

<p>
"'It is I, Shoan.'
</p>

<p>
"'No (you are not).  Shoan died with his father
on the sea.'
</p>

<p>
"'Look at my face.  I am Shoan, your son.'
</p>

<p>
"He came up into the house.  When they heard
(about it) all the people (of the village) came.  They
asked many questions and Shoan answered.  He told
the story about the whale, and the story of his
marriage with Giri.  The people laughed and said he
was telling lies.  Shoan got so angry.  He ran away
with the looking-glass.  The people went after him
and speared him, and thus killed Shoan.
</p>

<p>
"Giri stops in the sea near the coral banks,
and she sings and calls.  In the night, when the
moon is high, fishermen hear a sound like singing
and crying of a woman.  They ask other people
(about it) and wonder, for they do not know (about)
Giri.  Giri will not return alone (that is why) she
sings and calls out, 'Come (back), Shoan!  Come
back, Shoan....'"
</p>

<p>
Ferlie used to love to think she could hear the voice
of Giri, crying loudest when the nights were happiest,
since the Grey Lady of Sorrow loves best to walk in
quiet places which have once known laughter and
love.
</p>

<p>
She and Cyprian lingered after the tale was finished
and the children in bed, dreamily feeding the
red heap of dying logs with grass and leaves and
rousing little spurts of angry blue flame.
</p>

<p>
To them came Jellybrand to crouch, rather
exhaustedly Ferlie thought, in the violet shadow;
his chin thrust forward; his thin shoulders hunched.
</p>

<p>
"It is difficult," he said presently, "to know quite
how to act when immorality creeps unexpectedly
into my small garden."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian glanced up at him sharply, but his ferrety
eyes were fanatically searching the embers for an
answer to the question troubling him.
</p>

<p>
"The Nicobarese are really a moral people.
The w-women have equal rights w-with the men;
in fact, being so necessary for the continuance of the
race, they are really considered more valuable than
the men.  And, though among the Unconverted,
a divorce can easily be arranged by the co-respondent's
paying the injured husband a fine of pigs,
one seldom hears of such a disastrous necessity."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause, during which Ferlie cleared
her throat nervously.
</p>

<p>
Then Cyprian sat upright.  "And by this you
are leading up to tell us, Padre...?"
</p>

<p>
"That there is a couple of professing Christians,
living in sin in the midst of the Mission," said
Jellybrand dejectedly.
</p>

<p>
It was out, and Ferlie sighed a little tired sigh.
So, even here, they were to meet with criticism.
She was past interesting herself as to how he had
guessed.  She hoped Cyprian would be patient
with him.  But Cyprian, blinking rapidly in a manner
that foreboded battle answered: "I should have
thought that what you may call 'living in sin' was
nobody's business but their own."
</p>

<p>
Little Jellybrand looked his amazement at this
unsympathetic attitude, from one to the other.
</p>

<p>
"How can it not be my business?" he asked in a
hurt voice.  "I am here to see that they set a good
example to one another.  And these were two of my
own children.  I baptized them with my own hands."
</p>

<p>
This naïve admission drew a choking laugh from
Ferlie.  As the padre turned his astonished face
towards her Cyprian exclaimed impatiently:
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord, man!  Are you referring to two
of the natives?"
</p>

<p>
"Who else could I be referring to?"
</p>

<p>
Ferlie, with a final gulp of relief, rushed to the
rescue.  "It's all right, Padre.  We were stupid.
Please tell us more."
</p>

<p>
Encouraged again, he confessed that he was having
great trouble with two actual communicants in
the Mission&mdash;Naomi and Kingfisher.
</p>

<p>
Naomi was, virtually, the wife of Young Brown.
She had played her star part in the most complete
Wedding Mass, decked out in the scarlet robes of
the Mission calico, two years ago, amid the general
rejoicings of a family much enriched by Young
Brown's substantial dowry of pigs and pandanas.
The pair had no children, and, a twelve-month
later, Kingfisher, who had been showing marked
interest in the Bible Class regularly attended by the
young wife, was brought forward by her for enrolment
in the True Fold.
</p>

<p>
The toiling priest had thanked Heaven before
the paper swathed night-light for this unexpected
windfall in addition to the slow fruits of his labours.
</p>

<p>
Some months after the baptism Naomi produced
a son whom Young Brown's common-sense did not
permit him to regard as an answer to prayer, and,
on his refusal to lay claim to the child, Naomi and
Kingfisher had boldly taken unto themselves a hut
on the outskirts of the Settlement, whence neither
consistent appeals to their better nature nor the
threat of excommunication could dislodge them.
</p>

<p>
"This is my man," was all Naomi had to say
about it.  And confronted with the Woman's Credo
her Father-in-God found himself helpless.
</p>

<p>
"The villagers consider that I ought to be able
to put a curse on them," he complained worriedly.
"The Mission is losing prestige by my very patience
and I fear a great deal of harm may be done to the
Cause.  I am wondering whether I should appeal
to the Chief Commissioner at Port Blair, since the
Nicobars, being under his jurisdiction as well as the
Andamans, he would be able to have the couple tried
and sentenced for bigamy."
</p>

<p>
Cyprian took his head in his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my hat!" he groaned.  "If I were the
Chief Commissioner, Padre, I would have you
locked up for a dangerous lunatic.  Living in sin!
Had they ever heard the word before you taught it
them?  By what authority do you keep a healthy
young female animal tied, for sentimental reasons
of your own introduction here, to a man who is
incapable of giving her a child?  Anyone sane would
tell you that the Law was made for man and not
man for the Law.  Let the poor unfortunates
alone, for God's sake."
</p>

<p>
Painfully, Jellybrand replied to him.
</p>

<p>
"There was a Man whom many accounted insane,
but Him only do I serve and from Him do I take my
authority.  And He said: 'Thou shalt not commit
adultery'."
</p>

<p>
For a moment nobody moved.
</p>

<p>
Then Cyprian threw a stone shatteringly into
the fire.  It lay there unaffected by the ruin of hot
ashes.
</p>

<p>
"These people are not Jews any more than we
are.  Why should any of us follow the letter of the
Jewish Law?"
</p>

<p>
"Hear how He amplified it to the multitude upon
the mountain who were not Jews," said the Padre,
and a hectic spot burnt on each cheek-bone as he
recited: "'Ye have heard that it was said by them of
old time, thou shalt not commit adultery, but I say unto
you that whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust
after her hath committed adultery with her already
in his heart....  But I say unto you, that
whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the
cause of fornication, committeth adultery, and
whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth
adultery.'"
</p>

<p>
Cyprian rose disturbingly, trampling the smouldering
branches under his feet and kicking the stone
back into the cool dewy forest.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to bed," he said.  "I prefer logic to
theology.  And my logical conclusion is that anyone
who applies the word 'sin' to these folks would be
quite prepared to try a tiger before twelve good men
and true, and hang him, for devouring a human
intruder in his jungle."
</p>

<p>
They heard his footsteps mounting the wooden
stairs of the bungalow blurred black against a starry
horizon.  From the distance stole the sound of
breakers on the coral reefs; the children's hammocks
were just visible under an ingenious canopy of
mosquito-netting.
</p>

<p>
"And will you also go away?"
</p>

<p>
The question was asked more to himself than to
Ferlie, but she replied to it gently; she, who hated
hypocrisy from the depths of a soul which felt
plunged into it.
</p>

<p>
"No, Padre.  I understand what you feel.  I
belong to a Church much criticized for its
adamant attitude towards such logic as is
Cyprian's."
</p>

<p>
"You cannot think," he told her in a broken voice,
"w-what it has meant to me to have you two here.
Merely to w-watch you both makes me less lonely.
It used to be my dream, before I vowed myself to
celibacy, that one day a w-woman might stand to
me, even me, in the same relationship that you
stand to him.  I could be tempted to pray for it,
even now."
</p>

<p>
She shivered slightly.
</p>

<p>
"And God would reply that you know not what
you ask," she said, so low that he did not catch the
words, and went on speaking: "But sometimes
I have thought that, in spite of the perfect
unity between you, w-which turns this self-chosen
isolation into an Utopia of contentment, there
is yet something troubling you; something
deep and painful.  Forgive me if I am mistaken.
Living apart, as I do&mdash;I have deliberately chosen
Mission work, you know, though Colonel Maddock
offered to help me to a Living&mdash;one's instincts
become sharpened, like a dog's when someone it
knows is in trouble."
</p>

<p>
Then Ferlie made a resolve she would have found
impossible to justify but, in after-life, found it
impossible to regret.  Peter had always condemned
her as doctrinally unsound, and wondered that the
Church could not see it.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the Church did see it but was wiser than
Peter in its utterly trained patience.
</p>

<p>
Poor Cyprian, who, in these lost islands, could
not escape the pursuit of the Men in Black.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Every Saturday evening the communicants of the
toy church arrived in a complacent body, turn-about
to kneel under the struggling night-light and receive
mild directions from their harassed shepherd,
balanced on the harmonium stool behind a yard of
green baize, as to the speedy restoration of
unlawfully-acquired coco-nuts and pigs illicitly retained in huts
to which they did not belong.  Most defrauded
neighbours could be certain of recovering the fowl
that was lost, before the metal bell was jerked by
Young Brown for Sunday Mass.
</p>

<p>
That Ferlie should contemplate lending herself
to such a farce acted as the final blister on Cyprian's
already irritated spirit.  Having divulged her
intention, he let fall a few dangerous remarks; quite
clever remarks most of them.  She only turned on
him the straight grey look he was learning to accept
as impervious to outside influence.
</p>

<p>
"I understand that you were going to preserve
an open mind on all these subjects with a view to
embracing my ideas?"
</p>

<p>
"How does this affect your ideas, Cyprian?"
</p>

<p>
"I fail to see what support you can expect from
that religious maniac in our affairs."
</p>

<p>
"I am not requiring either his support or his
advice over <i>our</i> affairs."
</p>

<p>
"In the name of Heaven what are you requiring
from him?"
</p>

<p>
"If you did not require it yourself&mdash;in the name
of Heaven&mdash;you would know."
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie, will you promise to resist the temptation
to confide in him, just because he wears a last
century's fashion in angelic uniform?"
</p>

<p>
His tone roused her to real anger.
</p>

<p>
"There are things which you are not at liberty
to say to me.  Every human soul knows of shadowed
places within its circle which even the angels dare
not enter."
</p>

<p>
He got up, took some native fishing-tackle off
the window-sill and made for the door.
</p>

<p>
"I won't intrude again.  If you'll not be needing
the boat to-day for the children, I suppose you can
have no objection if I take Kingfisher, my
fellow-sinner, and go fishing."
</p>

<p>
She saw the pair of them from her window,
plunging into the jungle, while she was washing
Thu Daw.
</p>

<p>
The little chap was beginning to say whole
sentences in English, though he seldom honoured
anybody but John with his conversation.
</p>

<p>
Drearily, Ferlie blamed herself for the reticence
which had prevented her from attempting to make
clear her reasons for admitting territory from which
all but Divine Love must be locked out.  She was
steadied by that conviction.  And Cyprian would
come back.  She must try and satisfy him before
seeking satisfaction anywhere herself.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
</h3>

<p>
Cyprian took the motor-boat to a further point
than he had originally intended choosing.
</p>

<p>
Kingfisher, who had fastened his canoe behind
it, with forethought concerning creeks which did
his intelligence justice, found his companion, even
for a foreigner, exceedingly stupid over the fishing.
Cyprian, on the other hand, was regretting
proper tackle, and finding Kingfisher's methods
irritatingly childish.
</p>

<p>
Everybody in the islands was childish.  Jellybrand
with his weak chin and his goggles, and his ridiculous
tuft of hair sticking out at the back, and his lisping
faith; the natives with their infantile intellects,
not half a degree removed from John's, and now
Ferlie with her clouded illogical trust in the differing
satellites of a long-dead Teacher, who, to Cyprian's
mind, had shown less courage in deciding the
doubtful question of the Life-to-Come than had the
Buddha.  Cyprian recalled the words of one modern
writer, "Buddhism is the religion of men; not of
children."  Assuredly, had the Christ only professed
to preach the religion of children.  Well, Ferlie was
a child.  She would outgrow it, and he, in the light
of his extra experience, must be patient.
</p>

<p>
It never occurred to him that there might be
something childish in his angry flight from the
thing that had annoyed him.  He decided to give
her time to get this uncomfortable mood over before
he went back and, consequently, steered the boat
towards a likely-looking creek biting into what was
known as the mainland.
</p>

<p>
To his astonishment he was checked by Kingfisher,
who, for some time past, had been shading
his eyes and muttering at the reflection of trees in
water so clear that it was difficult not to believe
that there was no material substance to the drowned
world it mirrored.
</p>

<p>
He now clutched Cyprian's arm, indicating that
they must not land.  The latter was in no temper
to be thwarted.
</p>

<p>
"Is it ghosts or devils which will prevent you,
Kingfisher?  Or is the ground tabu on account of
a birth or a death?"
</p>

<p>
The man could not explain himself any more
clearly than to insist that it would be unsafe to land.
</p>

<p>
His fear was very genuine and when he had
gauged Cyprian's obstinacy he climbed resignedly
into his canoe, from the motor-boat, and cut it
adrift.
</p>

<p>
"All right!" Cyprian agreed cheerfully, "If
you fish long enough you may catch a whale.  I am
going to explore."
</p>

<p>
He beached the motor-boat, and the jungle
swallowed him up.
</p>

<p>
Then Kingfisher did a very sensible thing: he
seized his paddles and made for home.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Ferlie was going down the forest road to the shore
to meet the fishermen.  Long before he saw her
Kingfisher heard her singing to herself and thought,
for a little while, that it was Giri.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh, ye'll tak the high road and I'll tak the low road,"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
... and ever the last two lines filled the green
gloom with haunting sorrow....
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But me and my true love will never meet again<br>
  On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But there was no sorrow in Ferlie's face just then.
</p>

<p>
It was the little padre who wiped the joy out of
it after he had seen Kingfisher.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
In a few moments everybody in the Settlement
had collected round the two of them while the sun
reached out long scarlet-sleeved arms through the
plain glass window of the church and took St. Paul
in a ruddy embrace.
</p>

<p>
The agent's face was grotesquely serious, thought
Ferlie.  No one could make her understand why
for quite a long time.
</p>

<p>
It sounded so incredible&mdash;the thing they were
telling her.  A patch of colour from a boy's adventure
book.  That there existed a tribe of savages, within
reach of a comparatively civilized Mission Settlement,
whose hand was against every human being
and against whom every man's hand was raised in
enmity; that Kingfisher's trained sight had noticed
signs of them along the shore in a vicinity to which
they seldom came, and that Cyprian, ignoring
Kingfisher's warning, had landed on that particular
stretch of beach&mdash;this was the gist of it all.
</p>

<p>
"But what will they do to Cyprian?" asked
Ferlie, desperately incredulous.  "He is unarmed and,
they can see, unaggressive; if they are not cannibals
why should they want to interfere with him?"
</p>

<p>
"They shoot at sight," explained Jellybrand
slowly.  "They do not wait to find out if harm is
intended.  They strike first, even at the neighbouring
tribes, w-which go in terror of them.  They are
called the Shorn Pen."
</p>

<p>
She turned on him in cold fury.
</p>

<p>
"And you never warned us!"
</p>

<p>
"They live so far afield; right out in Great
Nicobar.  How w-was one to dream&mdash;&mdash;?  The
Andamanese have a similar tribe to cope w-with,
the Jarawas.  But they, like the Shorn Pen, are so
seldom seen that one forgets.  For centuries the
Shorn Pen have managed to isolate themselves from
the remaining islanders, and they are now practically
a different people.  Markedly Malayan.  Intermarriage
and contact with foreigners has altered
the ordinary Nicobarese and civilized him."
</p>

<p>
She became, of a sudden, stoically calm.
</p>

<p>
"What are we going to do about it first?"
</p>

<p>
Jellybrand and Mr. Toms, having decided on a
search-party, had a little difficulty in organizing
their men, and, since this too was necessary, in
arming them.
</p>

<p>
The people, by nature, were no heroes, and it
took more than the sight of the foreign lady's stricken
insensibility to induce them to collect canoes at this
late hour, when the labours of the day should be
over.
</p>

<p>
The padre's influence did more than Mr. Toms'
promises of reward, but little Jelly, having finally
shouldered his shot-gun, was surprised to find
Ferlie prepared to accompany them armed with a
small despatch case and Cyprian's revolver.
</p>

<p>
"The children, Mrs. Sterne," he stammered.
"Surely you w-will remain w-with them."
</p>

<p>
"There will be Naomi and Young Brown," said
Ferlie coolly.  "And I want to explain that, should
anything happen to us, those converts who take
care of the boys till my brother and Colonel Maddock
return will be very substantially rewarded for their
trouble.  I have left a note with Naomi."
</p>

<p>
The hardness of her voice frightened him.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing should happen," he said haltingly.
"Really&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She was not listening.
</p>

<p>
"John," she called, "Come here."
</p>

<p>
He came, dragging his imitation spear, and she
knelt down putting her arms about him.
</p>

<p>
"I have got to go away for a little while, John.
If I do not get back very soon, wait for Uncle Peter
and look after Thu Daw.  And when Uncle Peter
comes, tell him that Mother went away to follow
Cyprian wherever he had gone.  Can you repeat it
after me?  Say, '<i>Wherever</i> he had gone.'"
</p>

<p>
He spoke the words wonderingly, straining back,
boylike, from the close pressure of her arms.
</p>

<p>
He was always proud to be entrusted with a
commission and the charge of Thu Daw.  Only
when she had hurried a little way down the road,
walking between the padre and Mr. Toms, some
intuition made him drop his weapon and run after
her, crying, "Mother!  Mother!"
</p>

<p>
She whirled back to meet him and lift him against
her heart.
</p>

<p>
"You are a man," she told him.  "And one day
you will stay by your woman, please God, as I am
going to choose to stay by my man to-night and
through Eternity."
</p>

<p>
Jellybrand surveyed the little scene, his face
troubled, but he did not again try to prevent her
from joining them.
</p>

<p>
In the canoe he leaned forward and touched her
cold hand.
</p>

<p>
"The smallest boy," he said softly.  "Did you
adopt him?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  He is Cyprian's.  His mother is dead."
</p>

<p>
He was puzzled, but not inquisitive.  Ferlie
added dully, "That was before we found one
another."
</p>

<p>
"I see."  said her companion compassionately.
And did not.
</p>

<p>
It took a long time in the canoes, under Kingfisher's
guidance, to arrive at the spot where, eventually,
they caught sight of the dim outlines of the
motor-boat.
</p>

<p>
There was no sign of any living thing on the
shimmering starlit shore.  The canoes crept closer
and closer, under the shadow of the bank, cutting
the water noiselessly as otters.  The foremost one,
containing Kingfisher, had only just been beached
when he took a sudden flying leap into the creek.
They heard him scruffling with someone on the
far side of the motor-boat.
</p>

<p>
The two struggled out into the open; two naked
forms grappling in the stream where the water was
just shallow enough to allow a precarious footing.
</p>

<p>
"Keep quiet!" commanded the padre in Nicobarese,
whispering, as another of their party splashed
to the leader's relief.
</p>

<p>
"There!  They've got him....  Yes.  It is one
of the Shorn Pen!"
</p>

<p>
The man was dragged towards the bank and a
dozen willing hands stretched out to draw him up.
Scarecrow, who, generally, showed more initiative
than his fellows, stepped forward to act as
spokesman.  Fingers were firmly pressed against the
prisoner's mouth, lest his alarmed shout should
attract his friends.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him," said Jellybrand, "that if he gives
us the information we require, no harm shall come
to him; but that on his making the least sound it
w-will be the w-worse for him.  Our revenge w-will
be horrible," he informed the man himself with the
utmost placidity.
</p>

<p>
The latter had, evidently, made up his mind not
to risk shouting.  Or, maybe, he was only a stray
member of the tribe, lured back to the motor-boat
out of curiosity.
</p>

<p>
To get him to speak, however, was another matter.
His dialect, also, differed from that of his interlocutors.
</p>

<p>
"He must speak," said Ferlie.  "He shall speak.
He will speak under torture."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Sterne!"
</p>

<p>
She wheeled round upon the padre as he advanced
hastily to her side, pushing him back into the arms
of his huddling flock.
</p>

<p>
"Let me be!" cocking the revolver.  "Stand
aside, any one of you who does not want to be shot.
But if I shoot this wild beast to bits, inch by inch,
I will know where Cyprian is to-night."
</p>

<p>
This, Ferlie, the long-suffering and so-compassionate
of all human pain.  There may have been
an hour, far back in some forgotten life, when she
stood, herself a half-savage incarnation of Womanhood,
surrounded by her slaves, directing the slow
doing-to-death of a feudal enemy who had deprived
her of mate or son.
</p>

<p>
Whether or no, the present captive, who had
obviously never set eyes until that moment on a
white woman, was startled by the impression that
she was an avenging devil, it was certain he
considered her supernatural.
</p>

<p>
He broke shuddering from his gaolers to prostrate
himself at her feet in crawling supplication.
</p>

<p>
In due time they extracted from him a promise
to lead them to "the place where they had put the
white man."
</p>

<p>
Yes, the white man had come there in the boat.
Yes, he had walked in the jungle.  Yes, he had been
captured.  The rest was not clear.
</p>

<p>
Jellybrand saw that, although they might be
moving directly into a trap, there was nothing for
it but to go on.  Everybody understood that there
would probably be a scrap.  They must rely upon
the terrorizing effect of their fire-arms.  He stopped
to make the sign of the cross.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie noticed that unsympathetically.  She
felt insanely cruel, and he avoided those wild
eyes.
</p>

<p>
It was not long before they arrived at a fired
clearing, the centre of which showed the remains of
an earth-oven.  A low bamboo platform, beyond,
supported a primitive hammock of plaited grass,
hung round with queer indistinguishable objects.
</p>

<p>
The whole thing suggested a funeral pyre; not
an unlikely idea, since the padre knew that the
Jarawas in the Andamans burnt the bodies of
their dead.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie was the first to push aside the grass and
leaves completely screening the still form on that
rude dais.
</p>

<p>
And then the birds of the forest rose in fluttering
distress, disturbed by the exceeding bitter cry of a
soul in torment.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian lay there with an arrow, dimly discernible,
pinning his coat to the dark stain which had spread
over his breast.  They held the dancing torches high,
and poured brandy between his lips, but he did not
appear to swallow; they splashed his face with
water from a flask and listened desperately for the
beating of his heart.  His hands were clammy cold.
</p>

<p>
The arrow had pierced clean through his coat to
the other side of the shoulder; after cutting off the
barbed head they were able to remove the shaft.
And Ferlie, having done all she could with no result,
flung herself moaning like a wounded thing upon
the charred ground.
</p>

<p>
All at once she raised her tortured face to the
priest's and out of the extremity of her suffering
challenged him.
</p>

<p>
"You talk of faith!  Use yours.  You talk of
prayer.  Pray!  You believe there is Someone to
pray to: speak to Him, then, but do not come near
me nor try to take this revolver from me, until I see
whether the God you uphold as faithful answers
faithful prayer."
</p>

<p>
It was fruitless to attempt comfort; utterly
hopeless to argue.  He knew that her face would remain
imprinted on his memory to his dying day, wearing
just such a look as must have shadowed the faces of
those sorrowing women who stood beneath the Cross
of the Beloved.
</p>

<p>
But he also considered the danger of resorting to
such prayer before the marvelling undeveloped
intellects of the adult children round him, so hardly-won
to Christ.  Their faith was ever-ready to rise
or fall to the success or failure of a sign.  How could
he thus tempt the Lord his God?
</p>

<p>
His hesitation scorched her to scorn.
</p>

<p>
"You are afraid!" she said.  "And there is not
even God left."
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" he pleaded.  "Hush, child.  W-wait
and I w-will pray ... that His w-will be done."
</p>

<p>
It was a strange scene: the girl writhing in her
mental agony at the foot of the savage bier; the
frail diminutive figure of the little shepherd, in his
unsuitable draggled white robe, who had proved
himself, whatever his weakness, no hireling to his
Master's flock; the scared human animal, naked
as his Creator made him, starting from the grasp
of the hybrid agent clad in khaki shorts and bowler
hat; and, behind, the straight smooth-skinned forms
of the Nicobarese, leaning on spear and long bow,
awaiting the miracle their Christian witch-doctor
must, surely, perform upon the white woman's man,
who lay so still in the dead light of torch and
mocking star.
</p>

<p>
Jellybrand knelt forlornly on the earth.  It has
been shown that St. Francis&mdash;the "little sheep of
Christ"&mdash;was small and starved of appearance with
no physical beauty but his transfiguring trust....
</p>

<p>
"Our Father&mdash;&mdash;"  And that was all.
</p>

<p>
For coincidence or miracle, at the same moment
the man on the rickety erection twitched one hand
faintly and opened glazed eyes.
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake get the arrow out!" he muttered,
and once more relapsed into unconsciousness.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Ferlie never remembered how they got him home.
</p>

<p>
From the fact that those present ever after
respected her as a superwoman, she supposed she
must have taken over charge again of the reins she
had relinquished, for the time being, to the padre
and his God.
</p>

<p>
In her dreams she would often hear the padre's
voice saying,
</p>

<p>
"Let him bleed; it is best."
</p>

<p>
She had necessary things with her in the despatch-case.
It was really blood-poisoning they had to fear,
for the actual hurt proved not serious.
</p>

<p>
They had reason to be glad of the glassy
night-harbour and the smooth stealing of their canoe.
</p>

<p>
Their prisoner they took with them, it being the
padre's inspiration to load him with gifts and send
him back to his tribe with a wholesome narrative
of good returned for evil.
</p>

<p>
He obviously expected protracted death, but
Ferlie was now indifferent to his fate, where she sat
silent in the bows, holding Cyprian's head on her
knees.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Toms clung to a theory that the Shorn Pen,
amazed at the appearance of their quarry, had left
him for dead at a popular festival ground, in charge
of the prisoner, wishing to display him to the rest
of their tribe before burning him with due ceremony.
Probably, not more than three or four were
responsible for the actual outrage....
</p>

<p>
Several delirious nights dragged between drawn-out
days of tireless nursing before Cyprian opened
comprehending eyes upon the world.
</p>

<p>
Before that hour came Gabriel Jellybrand had
learnt more than he had ever sought to know of his
new friends.  He took his turn at watching beside
the fever-stricken bed and was able to spare Ferlie
a considerable amount of the sick raving that wrung
her heart.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, Cyprian, who so seldom needed to
emphasize his speech with oaths, would break out
into frantic blasphemies entirely alien to his mentality.
</p>

<p>
"It is nothing."  And the padre would describe
other sick-beds at which he had officiated.  "He is
not worse.  It is as if he were speaking in a foreign
language, absorbed at some time or other by his
sub-conscious mind."
</p>

<p>
But always the sick man returned to the same
poignant theme; that Ferlie was his and the barrier
between them a figment of her imagination.
</p>

<p>
"Do not distress yourself over that delusion
either," Jellybrand implored her.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Ferlie at last, shocked by revelations
of the restraint it had been Cyprian's part to endure.
"That is not delusion.  That is Truth....  And
now you know...."
</p>

<p>
"My poor child," he answered, "I ought to
have understood....  I am not very clever, you
see.  I only w-went to a cheap school.  My mother
w-was a w-widow and did mending for Colonel
Maddock at one time, in order to give me my
chance.  He w-was very good to us.  But I only
got through my exams by much prayer....  My
mother prayed too, and that helped.  I w-was able
to visit her as an ordained priest before she died....
I, wh-wo w-was so stupid and&mdash;and not very
strong.  W-we both felt that God had w-worked a
miracle."
</p>

<p>
She saw that he was shying away from her
admission, eager to show that he claimed no right
to pry into more than she willed to confide in him.
</p>

<p>
It was inevitable then that she should make known
to him the circumstances which had driven them to
seek temporary refuge at some spot where they would
not be hampered by the living lie represented in their
lives side by side.
</p>

<p>
"And even here," she finished pathetically,
"there was you to deceive."
</p>

<p>
He thought it all out for some while before his
slow wits responded gropingly.
</p>

<p>
"You see, though God understands, His 'little
ones' can't.  And it is forbidden to cause them to
stumble....  And so again...  There were only
three magi w-who came across the thirsty desert
in their w-wisdom to the Cradle.  But many shepherds
clustered about it, simple and adoring, w-who
imagined the star to have been lit in the Heavens
that very night by some supernatural hand.  The
w-wise men did not seek to convince them, by
astronomical data, that it had probably existed
before the w-world began.  They merely followed
them and adored."
</p>

<p>
"But they did not accept the shepherds' view,"
objected Ferlie.  "They reserved their own.  What
matter, if it was the same star and led them to the
same Cradle?"
</p>

<p>
"I know&mdash;I know.  But, by action, they accepted
the belief of the simple folk.  They conformed,
outwardly, for the sake of those 'little ones'..."
</p>

<p>
He passed his hand over the back of his head,
accentuating the tuft of hair, like a drake's tail.
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry for the W-wise; they have such
heavy responsibilities."

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
</h3>

<p>
The day came, at last, when she was able to
approach the subject with Cyprian, lying in a
hammock beside her under the trees.
</p>

<p>
He had, up to now, avoided all reference to his
unsatisfactory departure, armed with fishing tackle,
into hostile territory.
</p>

<p>
As she sat making tea, late in the whispering
afternoon, preparatory to hailing the padre from
his drudging attempts in the Mission school to
explain the evil of coveting your neighbour's pig,
likewise his pandanus grove and his coco-nuts and
anything that is his, including his wife, she looked
up to catch Cyprian's whimsical expression.
</p>

<p>
"Which of us apologizes this time, Ferlie?  Me?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll let you off," she replied shakily, "If you'll
make adequate restitution by getting well."
</p>

<p>
"I am well."
</p>

<p>
She took his cup of tea to him and placed it
within reach of the uninjured arm.  His stiffened
shoulder still prevented free use of the other.
</p>

<p>
"The monsoon will be breaking soon," dreamily
twisting a floating curl round his finger as she
stooped, "Shall we remain on here and beset the
even tenor of Jelly's existence with a similar
problem to his bigmatical ones?"
</p>

<p>
"Cyprian.  He <i>is</i> a little saint!"
</p>

<p>
"I know it.  You are both saints, and I eye the
haloes with envy, but not much hope.  I want you,
as well as your halo."
</p>

<p>
"Take!" said Ferlie.  But she went back to her
chair and sat looking at John chasing Thu Daw
across the clearing.
</p>

<p>
He followed their flight and then said, "We
can't stay.  'Unto each his mother beach, bloom
and bird and land.'"
</p>

<p>
"That's true," agreed Ferlie, and rolled Thu
Daw's ball back to him from under her chair.
</p>

<p>
"What will we do about it, Cyprian?"
</p>

<p>
"What indeed?  John's future is clear.  Winchester,
I suppose, and Oxford, and so to Black
Towers, finally.  You are right to remind me where
the greater responsibility lies.  At an English school,
would he find himself out of it?  Would they take
him?"
</p>

<p>
"If we could circumvent the first question he
could live the other down."
</p>

<p>
"Why should he be forced to live down my&mdash;sins?"
</p>

<p>
"The alternative is Burma, and, there, you and
I have much to live down, whatever course we take."
</p>

<p>
"Ferlie!  For God's sake reassure me on one
point."
</p>

<p>
To that stifled passion she instinctively reached
out comforting hands.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you are not thinking of separation?"
</p>

<p>
She said, "I hardly know.  It seems to me we
cannot go back now on what we have done.  As we
might tell Peter, 'there must be pioneers!' ... But
I do think our pioneering is going to lie along
a very rough road and I am afraid&mdash;for you."
</p>

<p>
The sight of Jellybrand on his way from the
school checked Cyprian's reply.  The padre beamed
joyously as Ferlie waved him to the second straw
chair.
</p>

<p>
"W-would you believe it?  My choir can now
sing the w-whole of 'There's a Friend for little
children,' by heart.  W-we are going to have it at
Benediction to-night.  The Bishop is not quite
certain w-whether I ought to be allowed Benediction,
as an extra service, but I hope to be able to persuade
him to my point of view when he visits us.  He's
not a very Protestant Bishop, and most w-wide
minded."
</p>

<p>
"Does it make any difference to Friend-of-England
and Co. which you have?" asked Cyprian.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing makes any difference to them, but it
makes a very great difference to me to be allowed
to teach and practise w-what I believe to be
necessary."
</p>

<p>
"If I were the Bishop," said Ferlie, "I shouldn't
be able to help feeling that you must know best
and that you mattered more than he did.  He has
so much to encourage <i>him</i>.  Does your brain never
bother you into believing the work useless and the
source of all your inspiration a dream?"
</p>

<p>
He crossed his knees, displaying a badly cobbled
rent in the trailing uniform he loved too proudly to
lay aside more often than was absolutely essential.
"Even my poor intellect questions sometimes.
Doubts come and go, but nothing can take away
one's past spiritual experiences."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know that a single unlooked-for spiritual
experience can influence a mind which leans naturally
towards agnosticism," put in Cyprian suddenly.
"There is a work-a-day agnosticism which satisfies
most men, supported by certain ethics, coloured
with what for nearly the last two thousand years
has been regarded as Christianity....  It is not
my fault if I have not a temperament which can
rest content on Faith.  I did not make my brain."
</p>

<p>
"That is just the point," said Ferlie.  "You are
incapable of making a single thing about yourself.
But you are able, if you wish, to insist that your
brain, and all the attributes of your particular
temperament shall serve instead of rule you.  Faith
is within the reach of all who reach out towards it.
The Christ, whose ethics you adopt, explained
that whenever He met educated doubting men."
</p>

<p>
"But sometimes," said Jellybrand, "one fears
to presume."
</p>

<p>
Ferlie saw that he was thinking of that night in
the forest when she had defied him to test his own
faith for her sake, and she replied,
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps that should be considered an experience
especially given to me."
</p>

<p>
Unexpectedly, he chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"W-would you like to spend a happy hour now
torturing our prisoner?  It might entertain the
invalid.  I have often w-wondered w-what I should
have done if he had not confessed and you had
proceeded to carry out your intention of making a
second St. Sebastian of him w-with revolver bullets."
</p>

<p>
"Did she intend doing that?" asked Cyprian.
"Ferlie, what a joke!"
</p>

<p>
"It was no joke, I assure you," contradicted
Jellybrand, "She stood there&mdash;w-would you believe
it?&mdash;w-with that horrid little w-weapon pointing in
all directions at once, and rank murder in her face."
</p>

<p>
Then Ferlie said a horrible thing.  So horrible
for her that the padre dropped his tea-cup and
Cyprian raised himself upright to meet her blazing
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I'd have re-crucified Christ!" said Ferlie.
</p>

<p>
In the petrified silence which followed Cyprian
extended his one arm.  She went to him, startled
into comprehension of her own words, and hid her
face in his sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," muffled tones assured them.
"Do you suppose that, because you don't
understand, all Heaven doesn't?"
</p>

<p>
Neither answered, till Cyprian said uncertainly,
</p>

<p>
"You might make me terribly conceited, Ferlie."
</p>

<p>
"Or terribly humble," she answered, still in the
dark.
</p>

<p>
Jellybrand mopped up, with his handkerchief,
the mess he had made, and poured himself out some
more tea.  His wrist was unsteady and he slopped
the milk afresh over the table.
</p>

<p>
"I meant to tell you both"&mdash;they heard his
words stumbling towards them through a clogging
mist&mdash;"I have thought a good deal about you&mdash;and
prayed.  But, somehow&mdash;I suppose because
I am not quite sure of my right to advise&mdash;light has
not come to me yet.  The solution slowly dawning
may be a mirage.  I must leave you to judge of that.
It is not for me to follow the w-wise across the desert.
My place is in the fields w-with the blind flocks.
Still, since you must go back and live practical lives
in a practical w-world, there is such a thing as
rendering unto Cæsar.  In this case&mdash;to a custom,
if an unlawful custom, as many considered Cæsar's
tribute.  Yet, the disciples were permitted to pay
that, to give their enemies no handle.  You could pay
it&mdash;this tribute to our so-called Civilization&mdash;by
obtaining your divorce and contracting, according
to the law of the land, to live together as it permits
you.  A marriage in a registry office counts as no
marriage to a Catholic; but this you know.  Your
lives together after it w-would be a matter for
yourselves and your own consciences, supposing you
can continue to live together under the same
conditions you have observed up to now.  If you find
you cannot, then I, honestly, see no w-way out but
the one w-which seems to spell living death to both
of you&mdash;separation.
</p>

<p>
"There is another consideration.  The Roman
Communion and its rules are outside my scope.
You know best w-whether it w-will permit a w-wife
separated from her husband, in such special
circumstances, to remain under the innocent protection
of another man, in a state fulfilling the demands of
both Civil and the Ecclesiastical Law.  In my own
very humble opinion&mdash;and I speak after much
consideration&mdash;the thing is permissible.  But I live
so far beyond the reach of those dogmatic burdens
w-with which Man impedes his progress to bear as
offerings along the steep road to God.  Clever
theologians w-would, doubtless, frustrate my
arguments, in one sentence.  I can only say that I do
not think they could alter my feeling in the matter.
</p>

<p>
"The views of any Church are immaterial to one
of you, who has been, hitherto, a law unto himself.
They are not immaterial to me; but my heart is
ready to let the situation rest between you and the
Greatest of all Lovers, who sees further than His
disciples in the Church."
</p>

<p>
The speaker pushed his untasted tea aside with
a little clinking jerk of china, and moved swiftly
away from the two under the restless palms.
</p>

<p>
In the distance they watched him climb the steps
of the toy ark and, a moment later, the cracked bell
clanged.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Cyprian spoke first, when the cadences of the
concertina would have been inciting to hilarity most
listeners superior to the Nicobarese and inferior to
the angels.
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever hear of Er, the son of Armenius?
No.  You never trod the mill of the ordinary Greek
classics.  Er was a brave man who was killed in
battle, and the story goes that, ten days later, his
body was discovered quite fresh.  The twelfth day
they laid him on a funeral pyre, when he wisely came
to life again.  He brought news that he had been
permitted to see the other world and return, and
described a long and complicated vision&mdash;Socrates'
idea of the justice meted out to Man after death.
</p>

<p>
"While I was ill my brain was troubling itself with
an account of the method by which the sky's vault
was held together, in the vision, at either end, by
a belt of light."
</p>

<p>
"What are 'whorls'?" Ferlie asked him suddenly.
</p>

<p>
He laughed, his fingers busy with her hair.
</p>

<p>
"I can well believe that I babbled about them.
Er's idea of the eight whorls, inserted in one another
was founded on the Greeks' conception of astronomy.
Never mind.  I'll lend you the translation....
</p>

<p>
"I am only prefacing my own vision (if you can
call it that when you know) with the mention of all
this, to show you how my mind has been running
on Plato for the sake of one passage in his Republic,
portraying Earthly Love as a frantic and savage
Master."
</p>

<p>
Said Ferlie, "He is a Master who can be enslaved."
</p>

<p>
"Your faith tells you so.  I only saw it in my&mdash;dream.
Do you know that I believe, like Er, I have
been dead?"
</p>

<p>
"You were dead.  Your heart had stopped beating.
You must have been unconscious for a long time.
And now, being you, you are wondering whether
knowledge acquired during an experience in Death
should be pushed aside by your well-balanced living
mind.  What did you see?"
</p>

<p>
"It was not exactly a seeing.  It was a knowing.
I was dead and I knew I was dead.  But I was still
alive, most terribly and poignantly.  You were the
Dead&mdash;on this side of the Dark, belted down, like
Er's universe, from the light.  But I was struggling
so passionately to return and be dead with you here,
rather than alive with all those other Living, that,
like Er, I think I was shown the way to break
through....
</p>

<p>
"One has heard of people in trances waking in
the grave.  Can you be sure with me, Ferlie, that this
was more than a trance?"
</p>

<p>
"God knows I can!" she said earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"You need not have been afraid.  I would have
wrenched the way through to you if you had not
come back to me.  For that reason I took your
revolver."
</p>

<p>
After a silence he said, "Then I see now why
I was allowed to find the way.  I was not worth
such a sacrifice ... the sacrifice of your unfinished
work here.  That is quite clear."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, never!  Never till that night did I know
the depths of my own weakness.  For the memory
I must go humbly all my days.  Cyprian, believe,
rather, that you have been allowed the vision because
only through its acceptance can you receive the
strength which must make me strong."
</p>

<p>
"Well, whatever the explanation," said Cyprian,
"it is only certain, as it was to another man before
me, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.  I see the
truth of the Resurrection."
</p>

<p>
Bright with revelation was Ferlie's face.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, it is enough and more than enough.  The
rest follows as it is needed, making all things possible
for us who can look forward into Eternity.  I fear
nothing, in whatever shadowy valley our steps may
be turned ... now.  The light will break some
time when our eyes are strong to bear it.  We have
been united in all things save the one thing that was
needful: belief in the Life Everlasting.  Without
that faith our love must have mastered us.  And
I knew it.  Your Frantic Master drives as his slaves
those who see no further than the end of this fragment
of life.  Cyprian, my lover, do you not understand
how it is that I am not afraid to stay beside
you now?"
</p>

<p>
Across the gilded bamboo leaves the children's
voices stole to mingle incongruously with the shouts
of the returning fishermen, to the drawling melody
of&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A Friend Who never changeth, Whose love will never die.<br>
  Our earthly friends may fail us,<br>
  And change with changing years ..."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Cyprian slipped out of the hammock and raised
Ferlie to her feet.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Yet, finally, the leadership, even in mystical
matters, was to devolve on him.
</p>

<p>
There were only thin wooden walls to the little
forest bungalow.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie and he had been sleeping indoors since
his illness so that she might have all medicines and
the paraphernalia for nursing within easy reach.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, it happened that in turning his head
restlessly to escape an intruding beam of moonlight
through the curtainless door, he roused himself
with sudden completeness, straining to catch the
echoes of quiet sobbing.
</p>

<p>
He only paused an instant.
</p>

<p>
Ferlie was lying face downwards: her forehead on
her arms, which gleamed lily-coloured in the pure light.
</p>

<p>
He knelt beside her, attempting to raise her head.
</p>

<p>
"My dear...  My dear..."
</p>

<p>
She grasped thankfully at the steadying sensitive
fingers.  "Help me, Cyprian!  You were always,
really, the stronger.  Help me to conquer it....
I know you have thought that everything mattered
a great deal more to you than to me.  That I was
satisfied with the knowledge that the end is not yet.
But sometimes&mdash;at night&mdash;Heaven is very far away
and earth is most powerfully real, and doubts creep
over me, who have laid the great burden of this
faith on you, whether I am fit to bear the burden
of my own human loving.  You see, Cyprian, there
is one instinct given to women at Creation; the
roots of which are in Creation itself.
</p>

<p>
"John is mine by duty and Thu Daw is yours by
desire, but I want&mdash;and, at the moment, I'd sell my
soul to eternal death to make it come true&mdash;your
son in my arms ... through love...."
</p>

<p>
So came again to Cyprian the inexorable phantom
of that Master of whose subjection he had been made
falsely confident by the soothing sympathy of a
celibate's idealism and the magic of Ferlie's trust,
a few short hours back.
</p>

<p>
Though he came in the form of an angel of light;
though he came in the form of a roaring lion;
though now in a more mysterious guise than either,
it was the same despotic power which drove and drew.
</p>

<p>
How to battle now with this image of shadowy
radiance?  And, after all, why?  He summed up the
matter afresh.  If there was not truth here it was
nowhere, and only in following the truth could man
be set free of his ills.  Thus had taught that same
Nazarene, whose spoken word of two thousand years
ago was causing all the trouble; since even in the
sceptical circles of modern scientific research men
were to be found to follow the gleam along His trail.
Across which lay Ferlie exhausted; himself
hesitating above her in the knowledge that she
would yield, inevitably, to the guidance of his
groping hands in the dark.
</p>

<p>
He had said to her, "I see the truth of the
Resurrection," and she had replied that all else
followed; but she had not then meant to signify
the strength for this sacrifice.  And he saw, blindingly,
that there might be no half-measures.  The ghost of
an unborn child barred the way of compromise.
</p>

<p>
Shaken with pain, mental and physical, Cyprian
of the once all-satisfying ethical agnosticism called
with the impotent despair which is akin to anger
upon that Lover who stood between them as lovers,
and who was becoming in conception unwaveringly
the same as the God who brooded over the disciplined
Churches.
</p>

<p>
"Why should Ferlie let them torture her?"
he had asked fiercely again and again of himself
in the past, and now that the power lay with him
to stay the hated pressure he found himself weakly
refraining instead with the question, "why should
I let them torture me?"
</p>

<p>
Even if separation had spelt material death for them
both, Ferlie's Church would concentrate only upon
the spiritual death their life together must effect.
</p>

<p>
Had not the time really come to dismiss as out-worn
sentimentality this talk of a soul's death?
</p>

<p>
His own, such as it was, and <i>if</i> he might barter,
and gladly, for the fathomable happiness of To-day,
despite that secret glimpse of wisdom imparted
during his unconscious hours.  But what of Ferlie's
soul, such as That was, and now in his keeping&mdash;a
stainless loyal Existent?
</p>

<p>
He had fought to make it see with material vision
and the mastering Force had fought on his side.
</p>

<p>
Yes, she had indeed fallen, spent, in the fearful
starlessness and it was his at last exultingly to lead.
</p>

<p>
Incoherent shreds of forgotten argument worried
him.  Magi or shepherds ... the wise with their
great responsibilities....
</p>

<p>
He became contemptuously aware of the aguish
shaking of his body.  How did one pray? ... How
<i>did</i> one pray? ... The opalescent tropical dawn
found him still at her side, his hold unrelaxed of
hands now at rest, the glory of her hair making a
halo about the face of a very tired sleeping child.
</p>

<p>
Above the dim blue mists still shrouding the
patient jungle the sun floated, a scarlet ball, heralding
the resurrection of another day.
</p>

<p>
Resurrection.  That whisper continued with its
insistence upon horizons beyond the vision of all
earthly eyes.
</p>

<p>
Others, like the legendary Er, had proved that
the pulsing of the soul does not cease with the
pulsing of the heart; nevertheless it was well-nigh
impossible to rest one's faith in this matter upon the
experiences of others.  Just in this matter.  One was
prepared to believe the incredible statements of
scientists and astronomers without wrestling
individually with their proofs.  Why not, therefore, the
vision of those who had eyes to see and ears to hear
beyond the grave?  His own past contact with that
death-state was failing to inspire now that his body
felt, once more, gloriously alive.  One had to
remember not to forget.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," had said that exasperating duplicate
of St. Francis in the islands, "can take away one's
spiritual experiences."
</p>

<p>
To that slender link with the future he must
trust.  Many had not so much and yet walked untroubled.
</p>

<p>
Was there not some special revelation for those
who, not having seen, were yet ready outside
Gethsemane's gates with the bitter admission,
"Thou has conquered, O pale Galilean"?  The
wraith of the dying Emperor, forced to accept such
defeat, seemed to smile mockingly at him from the
distorted patches of light and shade outside.
</p>

<p>
Cyprian appreciated afresh that Ferlie would
hardly prove courageous enough to face her own
defeat now without waiting on his decision.  His to
lead, forward or back.
</p>

<p>
And with the poignant realization something
snapped.  He rose stiffly to his feet to stand a moment
at the window, drawing the salt sea-breeze into his
lungs.
</p>

<p>
The surrender had become suddenly possible.
</p>

<p>
He lifted tired eyes to the on-stealing light and
his lips moved.  They framed the one word which
Ferlie, waking, might have recognized as representing
the clarion call of her utter triumph.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Vicisti</i>," said Cyprian.
